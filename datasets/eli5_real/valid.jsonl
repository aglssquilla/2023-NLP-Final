Google has the money, but most local governments have some sort of contracts with 1 or more ISPs that essentially grant them a monopoly(or a near monopoly) over certain areas.

Our hearing doesn't turn off and our brain continues to process the incoming noises as we sleep, it just filters out noises it is ok (read safe) with. Anything unexpected and different then what it is expecting and the info is sent through to a different level of processing and you may wake up.

They pronounce Sidhe as Shee as well, just how their phonetics evolved"}
{"src": "Why is the name \"Sean\" pronounced like \"Shawn\" when there's no letter H in it?", "trg": "i dont understand why the english language doesnt have accents, can someone explain to me why people just decided to drop them from the language? its such a foreign concept to english speakers but when you learn a bit about a language with them it just makes pronunciation easier."}
{"src": "Why is Human Resources (HR) not an independent and objective unit reporting directly to Board (like Internal Audit), in order to be Pro-employee instead of Pro-company", "trg": "HR is not about being pro-employee. It is about preventing the company from being subject to lawsuit, and weeding out problem employees from the work force so that production/efficiency goes up. Any benefit to the employee is purely coincidental. The function you are wanting is covered by OSHA governmental agency for safety concerns, and Unions for quality of life concerns."}
{"src": "How can people doubt huge moments in history, like the holocaust or men landing on the moon?", "trg": "A must see hilarious mockumentary on moonlanding conspiracy is Dark Side of the Moon by William Karel 2002. Some interviewees - Buzz and Lois Aldrin, Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld and many many more. I watched it without realising it was a joke until it was part way thru. Felt my known world collapsing around me, then became suspicious, then couldn't stop laughing. Dirty rats, had me goin' for a bit."}
{"src": "How can people doubt huge moments in history, like the holocaust or men landing on the moon?", "trg": "The 'fact' there are so many conspiracy theorists is actually in itself a wide-ranging conspiracy spread among the masses by the Trilateral Commission and Knights Templar, the Illuminati and Dick Cheney. As the masses focus on this inconsequential crap. these major manipulators go about their dirty work in plain sight. We're all destined to become Idiocracy slaves and I know this because it's all written on the Dark Web. (ref: www.dark.web/com)"}
{"src": "If \"we\" are going to Mars soon, why do we mind so much that the Rovers (etc) do not \"contaminate\" the planet?", "trg": " > the planet will be completely Terra-formed That's unlikely to occur on any conceivable timescale, if ever. Minimizing contamination now, means there's more to study without worry that your samples are already contaminated. For example, it'd be really annoying for one of our probes to 'discover life' only for many man hours of research to discover it is some earth bacteria clinging to the drill bit or what have you."}
{"src": "Why do semi trucks leave behind huge chunks of tires on the road?", "trg": "yes a lot of trucks use retreaded or recapped tires but the real reason is because the tire wear out and fail. It common for a truck to go over 200,000 miles in a year. Thats 6.6 times more than the average car. Plus 4.5 times more tires means 30times more chance of tire failure over a normal car"}
{"src": "How does a smoker feel, when wants to smoke, but doesn't have a cigarette", "trg": "I once \"taco'ed\" a quad at the dunes... broken clavicle, separated shoulder, separated sternum, 3 broken ribs and broken ulna. I regained consciousness before anyone noted the accident and in a panic desperately struggled to get up and walk to prove I wasn't crippled. Same panic ensued when my head went through a windshield in car accident. That panic and fear is similar to how I feel when I don't have a smoke easily accessible. As a matter of fact, I'm feeling a little jittery right now."}
{"src": "The semicolon, when to use it and why it matters.", "trg": "You use a semicolon when you want to join two related statements together, but don't want to use a 'joining word' like _but_ or _and_, or you don't want to imply as long a pause as a full stop/period. For example: *I went on vacation the other day; the flight was very long.* An important point is that both statements should be complete sentences in their own right. In other words you should be able to use a period instead of a semi-colon and still have both statements make sense."}
{"src": "Kim Davis, Rowan County, Kentucky who is refusing to issue gay marriage licenses", "trg": "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. - Romans 13 Any questions, Ms. Davis?"}
{"src": "Kim Davis, Rowan County, Kentucky who is refusing to issue gay marriage licenses", "trg": "Can someone explain the argument of a Hindu man being thrown into jail for refusing to slaughter a cow. I don't understand the similarity. Wouldn't the cow have already been slaughtered and he would be filling out the paperwork stating the cow was slaughtered? It's a state document for an action that has already taken place, correct?"}
{"src": "There is no archeological evidence that dragons ever existed. So, if they're simply imagined, how is it that they're present in almost every major culture and depicted so similarly?", "trg": "There are three predators that hunted and killed early humans (and other mammals) that we instinctively fear; birds of prey, big cats, snakes. A dragon is a manifestation of those three. Finding dinosaur bones only helped fuel our imaginations."}
{"src": "What was the difference between the socialism of Nazi Germany and the socialism of the Soviet Union?", "trg": "Hitler even said himself that Germany wasn't socialist. They just said it was to win the worker vote because the USSR popularized socialism. The USSR actually was socialist, of the Marxist-Leninist variety. Their state was controlled by class conscious workers and their means of production were controlled by the working class through this effect."}
{"src": "I've heard that you can easily learn a foreign language if you watch foreign language tv. So if I watch tv in spanish, will I learn spanish? How does this work without subtitles?", "trg": "I don't think it works very well, either for me or for non English speakers I've heard of who tried. The thing is, to learn a language you have to practice speaking and writing in it. Just inputting it is too passive."}
{"src": "Why didn't the European settlers die of diseases that the Indians had like the Indians died of European diseases?", "trg": "The European settlers brought worse(better?) diseases with them and also as a result had stronger immune systems. By the time Europeans began settling the America's they had already been trading with the rest of the world for centuries and swapping diseases along with trade goods. Also Europe around that time tended to be nasty, dirty and crowded and a good breeding ground for nasty bugs. Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond(there's also a PBS special) gives an overview of all of this."}
{"src": "Can Someone Explain What Is Going On With The Refugee Crisis In The Middle East and Europe?", "trg": "* The middle east is a shithole for a number of reasons. * People are leaving in masses. * Europe has land and sea borders with countries that are near the middle east. * People are overwhelming those borders and trying to get as far as possible away from the middle east."}
{"src": "What is shock? what does it mean when your body goes into a state of shock?", "trg": "Shock is the name for any time when your tissues need more oxygen than your body can provide. Examples are if you have lost blood (hemorrhagic shock) or if your heart is pumping too weakly (cardiogenic). In septic shock, the blood vessels dilate and are leaky so supply drops, and the oxygen demand is higher due to the infection and inflammation."}
{"src": "Why are some animals tasty and some not? Would we be tasty if prepared properly?", "trg": "I remember reading, years ago, that lions in Kenya etc. developed a taste for human flesh because we're saltier than their typical prey. If that's true, then how we taste would depend on how much salt you like in your food."}
{"src": "What (Who?) Exactly Defines a Reliable News Source?", "trg": "For my own sake I try to browse news sources from all over the world. This tends to cut down on specific left/right narratives for a specific region and allows you to extract just the relevant facts of the story. Some discretion and intelligence is needed"}
{"src": "how the pyramids were built, and why there are conspiracy theories about it.", "trg": "Conspiracy theories are just an argument from ignorance. I don't understand how people could have built the pyramids with their level of technology so [insert dumb idea to explain it] god did it, aliens did it, or they must've had some other type of outside help we are unaware of."}
{"src": "Why doesn't a phone with its ringer set as 'vibrate', eventually destroy the mechanisms inside working it?", "trg": "The vibration is driven by a tiny bit of metal with an imbalance of weight on one side. The diagram [here]( URL_0 ) shows the mechanism. The red part is the imbalanced metal, and it rotates, causing vibration. It doesnt destroy the phone because its very contained. Besides that most phones are made to withstand a couple drops on the ground, so they are sturdy enough to handle vibration."}
{"src": "Why are most major religions right-wing, when their central figures are left-wing?", "trg": "Right-wing politics largely centers around a small, efficient government, low taxation, low regulation, and relies on the free market. This goes hand in hand with the rejection of authority - and religious people believe in a divine authority far more powerful and important than an Earthly government. Thus, they do not trust their government to have a hand in more things than the bare minimum, and their allegiance is to God, not the government."}
{"src": "Why is it that some pregancies are described as the best overall feeling a woman has ever, and for other women, the worst they have ever felt? Why is it great for some and terrible for others?", "trg": "Obnoxious hormones. It was novel to me to see such drastic changes. I liked that I became curvy, but just standing made me short of breath, and sleeping was a struggle. Depending on the hormones, I felt one way or another. It's similar to drinking in that you have happy drunks and angry drunks, and it's usually based on how they felt before they started drinking."}
{"src": "Why do babies and toddlers love other babies (including dolls) so much?", "trg": "Play. Babies/children love play. They are hardwired to want to play, because through play they learn. Baby lions play fight and hunt, baby deer play hide and run. When a baby sees an adult, an adult can represent food, cleaning, time to sleep, time to wake, time to cuddle etc. But when a baby/child sees another baby/child it means its time for one thing: play!"}
{"src": "why are most calico cats female?", "trg": "The gene for fur coloration is found on the portion of the X chromosome not present on the Y. In order to get calico or tortoise shell, you need two different genes...that's possible if you are XX, but not if you are XY. The male cats that are calico usually have the abnormal XXY configuration."}
{"src": "When the wifi is super slow why does restarting router magically fix it?", "trg": "Related question: why does my SNR get progressively worse until I restart my router? It doesn't happen every time, either, so assuming it's something external causing it, why does restarting alleviate the problem?"}
{"src": "Why isn't the horror genre as respected as other film genres?", "trg": "I thought the premise of The Purge was incredibly wasted. It's interesting, brings out the worst in people, and just bleeds suspense. But then they go and lock the family in the house and then it's a simple home invasion horror story. If they had done something such as a family going camping far away and losing track of time before the Purge, realize the date, and then have them flee terrible people while trying to get back home to safety - that would have been something worth watching."}
{"src": "Why does using data on phones cost so much money?", "trg": "One reason is because they can - they control your ability to connect to the internet from almost wherever you want, so they can charge more for it than you would pay for home internet. Another reason is that it costs them a fair bit of money to build and maintain that network, so the cost gets passed on to you, the customer."}
{"src": "How did Ireland export food during a famine without the people revolting?", "trg": "Revolutions almost never occur when things are bad and getting worse. When people don't know how they will feed their children, they focus on that and solely that. Almost all revolutions have occurred as circumstances got better. Once you know you can feed your kids, then and only then can you focus on tomorrow."}
{"src": "What are the benefits of marriage in the U.S.?", "trg": "There are health benefits, such as lower stress, lower cardiovascular disease risks, and longer lifespan. Legal benefits, such as inheritance rights, health care decision making rights, and spousal immunity. Financial benefits, such as lower insurance rates, possible tax benefits, and shared expenses."}
{"src": "Due to Time Dialation, are there places in the Cosmos where the Universe is only minutes old instead of 14 billion years?", "trg": "Not really an answer to your question, but I suggest you take a look at the [Kurzgesagt]( URL_0 ) channel. That channel has educational videos (with amazing animations) that makes science seem so **amazing**, or as they say it:  > Videos explaining things with optimistic nihilism. We are a small team who want to make science look beautiful. Because it is beautiful. They have **countless** videos on all things space-related and I **HIGHLY** suggest you watch them!"}
{"src": "Why do some people find GMO controversial when farmers have been modifying crops for centuries?", "trg": "Most people also don't understand the science behind genetic engineering, whereas selective breeding sounds safe and familiar (even though GMO foods have undergone way more safety testing) - fear of the unknown."}
{"src": "Why is it a ticketable offense to ride in a car without seatbelts on yet a motorcyclist that faces the same risks with less protection doesn't have to worry with such restraints?", "trg": "It has to do with insurance. Crash studies prove car seatbelts work and Insurance company's incentivise police departments to enforce seatbelt law with tickets and checkpoints . There actually we're politicians who wanted to enact a seatbelt motorcycle law. It got scrapped when enough people told them it was utterly stupid."}
{"src": "Why is it a ticketable offense to ride in a car without seatbelts on yet a motorcyclist that faces the same risks with less protection doesn't have to worry with such restraints?", "trg": "It would be less safe to strap yourself to your motorcycle. This is why most states have helmet laws. Why not make people in cars wear helmets too? The two things are different and it's all about the amount of safety that society has deemed to be \"acceptable\" given the trade off of inconvenience."}
{"src": "Why are there so few venomous creatures in the UK and Northern Europe?", "trg": "Venom isn't cheap, metabolically speaking. It's a risky investment in cold climates, since food isn't always readily available. Does no good to pack a venomous bite if there is nothing to bite. That's why you see other \"safer\" adaptations in cold climates, such as hibernation, which conserve resources."}
{"src": "Why are there so many more poisonous/venomous animals in Australia than the rest of the world?", "trg": "Proportionally, there are just as many venomous snakes and spiders as most of the rest of the world. Due to there being a larger number of snakes and spiders in Australia versus colder places, there are more venomous species. For example, if a certain percentage of snakes are venomous, then the more snakes in a given area the more venomous. Still at the same proportion though.  URL_0 "}
{"src": "Why doesn't our moon have an actual name?", "trg": "It does, it's the Moon, just like the Sun is the Sun. When these objects were named, they weren't thought to be individuals in a category. They were thought to be unique. When more like them were discovered the term was applied more widely."}
{"src": "The psychology behind why some people are so attractive that they are unattractive?", "trg": "Well this thread isn't going where I thought it would go. I thought we were gonna speak objectively about looks and how people like Anne Hathaway and Allison Williams are pretty much perfect looking but it's hard to find them attractive because they're dead in the eyes. Instead everyone's just talking about standards and who they want to sleep with."}
{"src": "If the blue pigment is so uncommon in nature, where did we get the pigment to create paints in times such as the Renaissance", "trg": "I know this! Lapis Lazuli! Lapis Lazuli is a really cool stone which is what was used back in olden times to create the blue dye you see in old works of arts. And because it was such a precious commodity people used it for the most prestigious of subjects. Hence why many of the paintings of the Virgin Mary are depicted with her in blue!!! Side note: many lapis lazuli stones contain flecks of gold in them further increasing the beauty of the subject painted with them!"}
{"src": "Why do pain killers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen help with fevers as well?", "trg": "Interestingly it is argued that the use of antiinflammatory and antipyretic drugs should perhaps be avoided with mild fevers and colds as you're counteracting some of the responses needed to effectively clear the infection!"}
{"src": "My eyes are red from allergies. Rubbing them makes it worse but it feels oh so good. Why?", "trg": "Allergies make you itchy. Rubbing things that itch makes it feel better. In turn you're rubbing your eyes with something that's probably covered in the stuff your allergic to, Making the irritation worse."}
{"src": "How do automatic guns deal with the heat that would be created from the friction of so many bullets passing through the barrel so quickly?", "trg": "For something small like an assault rifle, the volume of fire isn't high enough to be a problem. With heavy machine guns, some have multiple barrels that can be cycled through as the cool, and some have built in water cooling."}
{"src": "why do the touch screens of some mobile phones only work with the finger. They dont work with a pen or anything else. Why so?", "trg": "All the answers here are far over-complicated. Here it is, as far as I understand it: There are wires underneath your screen. These wires are not grounded. You have electrons moving through your body. When you touch the screen, the electrons can run from the battery of your phone, to the ground you are standing on, thus completing the circuit. Your phone registers where the circuit is formed, and voila! Touch screen magic"}
{"src": "What is the true difference between Crackers/hackers and Script Kiddies?", "trg": "Put simply, a Script Kiddie doesn't understand what they're doing - they just get a tool from someone else and hope it works. Someone worthy of respect will take the time to learn why the tool works, and perhaps improve upon it."}
{"src": "How come the human body can protect you from chickenpox and other diseases after you have it only the once! But i get the flu maybe 4 times a year and i just feel its getting worse every time", "trg": "Chicken pox doesn't really change much. Flu however, there are many different strains and they're constantly changing. Imagine it like this. A guy walks up to you and sucker punches you. You recognize him when he walks up to you in the future, so you can just punch him first. Now imagine he has a brother who wears disguises. You never really know it is the brother until you get sucker punched."}
{"src": "What happens to your account on sites like Facebook, reddit, twitter, youtube, linkedIn when you die?", "trg": "I have a friend that died a few years ago that I'm still friends with on Facebook. His page was originally full of kind words of people that knew him, but now it's a mashup of random spam and the occasional \"I miss you\" post."}
{"src": "Can a sufficiently rich person park in \"no parking\" spaces and just keep paying the fines?", "trg": "Actually yes, and it happens. Steve Jobs was notorious for constantly parking in handicapped spaces even before his cancer made that justifiable, and he ducked California's mandatory license plates law by *trading in his car for the exact same model every six months.*"}
{"src": "Can a sufficiently rich person park in \"no parking\" spaces and just keep paying the fines?", "trg": "I think Steve Jobs was famous for breaking \"non-moving violation\" type driving laws, and would just pay the fines. Since he was a billionaire the fines were to him what being fined half a cent might be to an average person, and that was only when he was caught. It was rumoured that he would drive without license plates, park in handicap spots, I guess stuff like that."}
{"src": "Is there some sort of YKK zipper monopoly?", "trg": "Its my understanding that their 'monopoly' was mad because they were the first to make an independent zipper that could be sewn in so companies like Levi could make pants, and just leave the zippers to someone else."}
{"src": "Why is marijuana \"impossible\" to overdose on?", "trg": "There is no credible documentation of death due to marijuana overdose in history. Studies to determine an LD50 have been largely unsuccessful and have varied results. While the numbers from studies vary, one example is that it would take smoking 3 pounds or ingesting 46 pounds to reach a toxic level. And that study is on the low end, but based on larger mammals. Many other numbers cited are much higher. Regardless of which numbers you choose to believe, it's just not possible."}
{"src": "Why is marijuana \"impossible\" to overdose on?", "trg": "Marijuana doesn't interact with the Medulla Oblongata, the portion of the brain which controls heartbeat and breathing, like other substances do. Where an overdose of alcohol can shut down your body's ability to continue breathing and your heart beating while you're unconscious, even if you were to smoke so much pot as to pass out your body would be able to continue to function at a basic level to keep you alive."}
{"src": "How come in Elementary school, we are taught that the Primary Colors are red, blue, and yellow, but in High School Physics, we're taught the Primary colors are red, blue, and green?", "trg": "Primary colors are just sets of colors that can be used to make other colors. For humans, we usually use three colors because our vision is trichromatic (based on three colors). RGB is often used in electronics. RBY is often used by artists. Cyan, magenta, and yellow are often used for making dyes. Basically, you pick three colors that can be used to make lots of other colors and you base your choice off of whatever works best for your medium."}
{"src": "How can there be a lowest possible temperature(-273K)? Why can't we go lower?", "trg": "Temperature is basically a measurement of the amount of motion in a substance. The amount it's bouncing around, vibrating, etc. Absolute zero is, more or less, when you can't reduce the amount of movement a substance is undergoing any more. There isn't really an \"absolute hot\" because physics puts no constraints on how much energy you can put into a system (other than general relativity saying that if you put enough in, it will eventually collapse into a black hole)."}
{"src": "Why does my dog bark at door bell noises from the tv when we don't even have a door bell.", "trg": "My doorbell makes a buzzing sound that doesn't sound anything like a traditional bell. Every time my dog hears a doorbell on TV, he runs to the front door as if someone is there. I think he connects it with people answering their doors on TV after hearing the bell but I'm probably giving him too much credit. He has no reaction to things like buzzers in basketball games or bells on gameshows strangely."}
{"src": "How pizza delivery became a thing, when no other restaurants really offered hot food deliveries like that.", "trg": "Fun fact: my city has places that deliver mexican, chinese, bagals, and even cookies. Anyway, as for why pizza: It's hard to make a good pizza without a lot of experience, but besides that the profit margin on pizza is very, very good. Because of this it is easier to assume the risks involved with delivery because the chance of profit is much higher than with other foods."}
{"src": "Why do Britain and other English empire countries still bow to monarchs? What real purpose does the queen serve?", "trg": "She's like a living historical monument to all of the monarchs that have ruled before her. You also have to remember that the monarchy creates an additional \u00a3300 million/year for the UK. Maintaining the monarchy costs the UK about \u00a350 million/year, BUT because of a hundreds of years old agreement, the monarchy owns land that it lets the UK government collect rent on to the tune of about \u00a3350 million/year."}

I like some modern art, and I put it to what I call the [Archer test, of \"Is this neat?\"]( URL_0 ) If it's neat it's neat, and I like it. If it's progressive and loaded with symbolism and a reductive expression of the form but it's not neat, it's crap. The great thing about art is that it's all made up.

{"src": "For over a year I've been reading about California being in the midst of an insane, unprecedented drought, but it seems like all the cities there are doing just fine. Where's their water coming from if things are so bad?", "trg": "Something to think about that many don't, is that water in California isn't just used by people. Between the Sacramento, Salinas, Central and Imperial Valleys, California grows a large portion of specialty produce that is consumed by the entire world. Crops need water to grow! The water shortage in California isn't just a problem for Californians."}
{"src": "how can a steak be matured for 28 days, but have an expiration date of 3 days when on the store shelf", "trg": "Steak needs to be matured without moisture. This is done either by hanging it in a dry room (the traditional way of doing it, but time consuming), or in a vacuum-sealed bag (quicker, and more common). [Source]( URL_0 ). When you keep steak at home, you can't control the atmosphere the way it's controlled by the producer. Because of this, it will go off much sooner."}
{"src": "With all the wireless technologies we use (Wi-fi, satellites, cellphone towers etc), isn't it a concern that it might get \"congested\" and cause the tech to fail?", "trg": "In the US there is an organization called the \"FCC\" or the Federal Communications Commission which regulates the frequencies which wireless devices can employ in order to prevent such interference and failures. Other countries have similar bodies."}
{"src": "Do people who learn to speak a second language think in that language as well as there original?", "trg": "After studying it for a four years, I went to Egypt to improve my Arabic. I lived with two Arabs, and by the sixth month I was dreaming in Arabic and would think of some things in their Arab words first. By the end, it depended what I was thinking about.

{"src": "Do people who learn to speak a second language think in that language as well as there original?", "trg": "Anecdotal, but back when I was reasonably fluent in Spanish, before 10 years of not using it set in, I used to occasionally dream in Spanish. I never \"thought\" in it per se, though I could if I exerted the effort to do so. The real breakthrough moment for me was actually when I stopped having to think of what I wanted to say in English first, before speaking it aloud in Spanish. I'm not sure if that counts as \"thinking in Spanish\" or not."}
{"src": "Is intelligence genetic? Are some people genetically predisposed to be better at things like math and arts?", "trg": "There were studies done on both adopted kids and twin studies. I believe the results were that intelligence is about 60-70 % nature and 30-40% nurture. [here]( URL_0 ) is an example of one such study, showing that in adopted kids (at birth), the child's intelligence has a significantly stronger correlation with the biological mother than the adopting mother."}
{"src": "If I have 'high blood pressure', why can't I just cut myself a little to reduce the pressure?", "trg": "It is not the amount of volume. It is the pressures inside your blood vessels...and therefore your organs. Blood letting would not cure hypertension. It might lower your blood pressure do to hypovolemia (loss of volume) for a period of time, but when your body recovers you will still have hypertension. And those damaging pressures on your organs, kidneys and brain specifically."}
{"src": "What is the purpose of the mesh lining inside swim trunks?", "trg": "I always thought it was built in underwear. On a side not, most inner mesh was kind of a net design, but I had a pair when I was young, very shiny blue pair that had a silk like lining on the inside, I used to love those trunks, so comfortable."}
{"src": "How exactly does shopping at small independent stores help the local economy?", "trg": "The argument is that local shop owners pay taxes in the city/county/state where they live and they spend their profits in that city as well. There's also a better chance that local stores source their goods from local producers. Non-local corporations pay some local taxes, but not as many and the profits are distributed to shareholders who will spend the money wherever they live and not necessarily in the city where the store is located."}
{"src": "Is there any advantage to suburban neighborhoods being twisty labyrinths of cul de sacs?", "trg": "It is purposefully built to make it so that there is not through traffic and what traffic is there does not go at high speed. Yes it does slow down emergency responders but those are not needed often enough for the slight slow down to be a big enough negative to make it a grid."}
{"src": "Why haven't we found a way to restore enamel on our teeth?", "trg": "Actually good news! I can't find the article anymore, but i read (on reddit a couple weeks ago) about a recent discovery where dentists will soon be able to \"add\" enamel to our teeth using lasers or something.

{"src": "Why does it feel almost required to sleep with our eyes closed? What does closing our eyes do that promotes the act of falling asleep?", "trg": "Ooh! I'll add to this something I have been wondering for 4.5 years now... as an adult, when I lay down in bed to go to sleep, I close my eyes right away. My kids, however, keep their eyes open until the moment they fall asleep and have since infancy. Is that just that they are fighting sleep? Is it that they fall asleep in minutes and I take 30+ minutes? Have they been faking being asleep the second they close their eyes for 4 years and I haven't noticed?"}
{"src": "Why does it feel almost required to sleep with our eyes closed? What does closing our eyes do that promotes the act of falling asleep?", "trg": "How do we choose to go to sleep? Like, at the end of the day, I may feel relaxed but not necessarily exhausted to the point of passing out. I just lay down, lie still, close my eyes and let my thoughts drift. Next thing I know, the alarm is going off. What about lower animals, like cats or dogs. Do they just consciously lay down their heads and close their eyes waiting for unconsciousness to sweep over them like us?"}
{"src": "Why do some vegetarians sight morals reasons for not eating meat/animals when animals eating other animals has persisted throughout history?", "trg": "Ethics specifically deals with the fact that humanity is sapient, and can reason before making choices. What other animals do really doesn't have an impact on ethics, because as far as we know, none of them can make a conscious decision to act differently."}

Took me time to realize I should have focused on the good times we shared and the joy he provided instead of anger and resentment. Cherish the time you guys shared. I'm glad science has made it easy to receive such prompt results. Beats seeing your buddy in pain with no clear answers."}
{"src": "Why does Afghanistan seem to be a hotbed for Islamic extremism while neighboring countries like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have remained relatively unaffected by similar unrest?", "trg": "A less extreme example is how the US seems like a hotbed of gun violence when compared to Canada. We're neighbors and in a lot of ways the same yet we differ a lot on this issue. When a cop shoots a suspect in Canada it's all over the news and people wonder how such a thing can happen here. I think that's something that's not newsworthy in the US."}
{"src": "Why does Afghanistan seem to be a hotbed for Islamic extremism while neighboring countries like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have remained relatively unaffected by similar unrest?", "trg": "Cause Pakistan one of its neighbors, recognizes the Taliban. They support and fund extremists elements to wage war against Afghani national army, the NATO forces and us forces. The Taliban find safe Haven inside Pakistan after it bombs places inside Afghanistan."}
{"src": "Why does Afghanistan seem to be a hotbed for Islamic extremism while neighboring countries like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have remained relatively unaffected by similar unrest?", "trg": "I've been to Turkmenistan. The reason why there is no unrest, is because the government is a brutal and callous dictatorship. Step out of line and you could get killed. Very North Korea-esque. The only major difference is they are oil rich. Having said that. The people were lovely. Imagine the Iranians, only even more attractive."}
{"src": "Why does Afghanistan seem to be a hotbed for Islamic extremism while neighboring countries like Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have remained relatively unaffected by similar unrest?", "trg": "The others are under varying degrees (to the degree necessary) of Moscow's whip. Any that feel seduced by the enticements, inducements and temptations offered by a certain former British colony only have to look at Afghanistan to see how that works out."}
{"src": "What do Germans think of Adolf Hitler?", "trg": "German here. Hitler is seen as the worst human being ever by most of the Germans. However, many also think that they have to feel guilty for what someone else did decades ago, which in my opinion is inapropriate - it's not my fault what Hitler did, right? Hence, I don't think I have any kind of responsibilty towards the jewish people. So that's the other side of the coin: You should not say anything against jewish people because you will instantly be called a Nazi. It's complicated."}

English is very widespread in western countries so is generally taught, if that makes sense"}
{"src": "How do \u201cthey\u201d determine how many calories are in something?", "trg": "To add to what was already said, you can measure the fat and protein contents of a food by blending it and measuring it with an infrared spectrometer, because fat and protein molecules have different absorption spectra, so you can get a somewhat rough approximation of caloric value that way. It isn't as accurate as a bomb calorimeter, but it is a hell of a lot faster and easier."}
{"src": "What is the story behind American cup sizes in cooking?", "trg": "It's standard imperial measurement. 1 cup=1/2 pint (8 oz.) 1/2 cup= 4 oz. 1/4 cup= 2 oz. 1/8 cup= 1 tablespoon Many measuring cups in the US are glass, and have both imperial and metric measurements marked. Funnily enough, I've gotten used to the metric measurement because I'm left handed, and the metric measurements are on what would be the \"opposite\" side for a right handed pourer."}
{"src": "Why aren't there seatbelts in public busses?", "trg": "Physics! The bus weighs so much that an accident will not be nearly as dangerous to passengers as a similar accident when in a smaller lighter vehicle. Most accidents would be with another vehicle, not a brick wall. So the bus would not instantly decelerate."}
{"src": "why is the Nazi flag taboo, but Confederate flag \"culture\"?", "trg": "Its not so much a difference between the Confederates and the Nazis as a difference between how Americans and Germans view freedom of speech. Americans strongly feel people should be allowed to express their views even when they are ignorant and hateful. Germans are more comfortable with forbidding offensive ideas."}

{"src": "If nuclear energy is so efficient, green and is incredibly safe nowadays, why haven't we constructed any more power plants?", "trg": "I currently work in the power industry. A few users have mentioned PR, and that's a part of it. Most of the reason though, is because it is incredibly expensive. The capital expense for building a nuclear power plant is huuuuge! A lot of companies aren't willing to spend that kind of capital because it would take a long time pay itself off."}
{"src": "What's so bad about Apple Maps?", "trg": "Well, Apple Maps is basically upsetting a ton of people because of false information. Apple Maps is using a company named TomTom, I believe.

{"src": "why is it safe to dry age beef, but unsafe to keep supermarket beef in the fridge for more than a few days?", "trg": "When you dry age beef, you are doing it in conditions that prevent many different types of bacteria from reproducing. In the fridge, none of the bad bacteria are actually killed, so they just slowly multiply. If you were to remove the beef from the store packaging, dip it in boiling water for a few seconds, salt the outside, then put it into the fridge uncovered with good air circulation, it will last much longer."}

{"src": "How is it that water at the bottom of the oceans doesn't freeze, if it's colder at depth? Why is it that water freezes downwards in large bodies of water?", "trg": "Ice floats, all the water that's close to being ice get's pushed to the top and cools water warmer than it. Warm water also \"floats\" on colder water so that also gets pushed to the top to warm the ice and water colder than it. At the bottom of the ocean is the water that's cold enough to push all the water warmer that it up to the top and also all the water colder than it to the top. That water is something that's 4\u00b0 celsius or 39\u00b0 fahrenheit. Look for James Cameron there."}

{"src": "what do military medals (purple heart, medal of honor, various service crosses) actually do for you after you are discharged?", "trg": "Once upon a time military honors meant knighthoods or other traditional medieval military titles. Compared to what they used to mean you are not wrong in that their value is partly based on a military culture and tradition that goes back to the age of chivalry, and in the context of the 21 century military awards are of dubious social value. But remember that military honors and titles come from a military culture that has its origins hundreds, if not thousands of years ago."}
{"src": "How is it possible to have 0ms of ping?", "trg": "if you think about it. actual zero ping means from the time your computer sends info, the server will already know about it. that's impossible. information needs time to propogate. wall street traders fight over which server aisle their servers are on so that the number of feet of cable is minimized to the trading exchange server. that gets them a nanosecond faster than the guy in the next aisle. your gaming application 10ms is a lifetime in wall street exchange numbers."}

{"src": "Why do people say teachers are underpaid when a high school teacher makes a median salary of 56,356?", "trg": "People who pat themselves on the back the hardest: Teachers Nurses Firefighters Paramedics All absolutely required in modern society, and very important to the health of a country, but man, do they like to talk about how great they are. You rarely hear about the plumber who comes out to a house at 2am to clear a backed up sewage pipe. Or the guys working 24/7 at the wastewater plant to keep your drinking water safe. Or the researchers working on cancer battling drugs."}
{"src": "Why do people say teachers are underpaid when a high school teacher makes a median salary of 56,356?", "trg": "Something like 75% of the teachers in colleges and universities are adjuncts. No benefits there, so no health insurance, vacation time, pension, etc. No job security either. You may or may not get an assignment next semester.

{"src": "Why is it okay for companies to fire employees on the spot but it is recommended/respected when employees give the company a 2 weeks notice?", "trg": "Because it's a relationship with a power imbalance\u200b. I don't do it though. Seen too many people let go as soon as they give notice. Happened at my last job. My supervision and the owner said he was a moron to give notice. They were them surprised when I failed to give notice. Huh."}
{"src": "Why is it okay for companies to fire employees on the spot but it is recommended/respected when employees give the company a 2 weeks notice?", "trg": "When a company fires you, they probably don't want you back and also don't need you as a reference... When you quit, and later try to get a new job, you stand a greater chance of needing the old company as a reference"}
{"src": "Why is it okay for companies to fire employees on the spot but it is recommended/respected when employees give the company a 2 weeks notice?", "trg": "Being fired and quitting aren't quite the same. The two week notice equivalent for the company is informing the workforce of upcoming layoffs or providing some form of pay in the case of layoffs. Quitting without notice is more like a company locking its doors at 5 on Friday after the pay periods and telling you not to bother come back in Monday."}
{"src": "Why do manufacturers make different types of screw heads?", "trg": "There are so many different head designs because of the huge number of applications in machinery like automobiles, aircraft, etc. The head type is going to be dependent on the characteristics of the joint you are trying to assemble with the installation of the screw. You can torque socket head cap screws more than a Phillips head screw which will result in more tensile preload in the joint."}

Putting the bow (front) of the boat straight into the wind puts you \"in irons\" (i.e. the sails are not catching the wind and you don't go anywhere). Edit: I've also heard the process called \"beating.\""}
{"src": "How do shows like the Walking Dead get such realistic backgrounds of places. (City, towns etc..)", "trg": "This is mostly accomplished, especially on The Walking Dead, by shooting on location. Their backdrops of Georgia look so realistic because it actually is Georgia. In other circumstances, it can be accomplished either by dressing a set to look extremely realistic or via green screen and CGI. Hollywood has employed many tricks of the trade for years to make even the shittiest of studios look real."}
{"src": "Why cursive writing exists and why we still use it today", "trg": "I haven't seen anyone mention the primary use for cursive in the US yet: signatures. We learn to write in cursive and then develop our own signatures with exaggerated forms of cursive so that we can authenticate documents quickly."}
{"src": "How do Germany regain its strength and standing in the global community so \"quickly\" after starting two world wars?", "trg": "Germany is a resource filled area, lots of people, and hard working nature. The Germans have been prided as industrialist and manufacturers for centuries. Not to mention after the war we put a shit ton on money into rebuilding them.

{"src": "Why does working a muscle to exhaustion with low weight and high volume vs high weight and low volume yield different results?", "trg": "Growth comes from damage to the muscle fibers.

Edit: source - am an anesthesiologist"}
{"src": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "trg": "Also an important medical reason for starting surgery early in the morning is the body\u2019s normal cycle of contra-stress hormones. Cortisol (stress hormones) have a diurnal rhythm and are high in the morning and decrease throughout the day. These extra stress hormones provide protection agains the \"stress\" of surgery."}

It implies they are both Islamic and a state. The UK government does not acknowledge them as a state. And they also want to push the idea that they are not really Islamic, to stop people jumping to the conclusion that all Muslims are like them. Daesh was created as a derogatory term for them which doesn't acknowledge them as a state or Islamic (at least not in English)."}

{"src": "How did Tumblr get its current reputation (i.e SJW's, \"check your privilege\", etc)", "trg": "You know, I use Tumblr and don't really see much nonsense. It kind of depends on what you search for and subscribe to. I think that /r/TumblrinAction members must be actively seeking out things that piss them off. Which is fine, I guess, if being pissed off is your hobby. But Tumblr is also a pretty good place to keep up with your favorite obsessive pop culture fandom. Watch out for the Sherlock porn. Or, you know, seek it out, depending on your preferences."}
{"src": "What happens to the information when you \"delete\" a file? (Ex. Empty your computer's trash, delete a picture)", "trg": "Deleting a file just tells the OS to mark that memory space as unused, allowing it to be overwritten by new files. Until overwritten, the file itself is still there, just there's no direct way to access it. But with the right recovery software, one can possibly find the file again unless it has been overwritten."}
{"src": "Why are shows like Dr.Oz allowed to give out health advice that isn't scientifically supported? How isn't this considered illegal?", "trg": "Why do less than half of the states require sex ed. in public schools and why are only 19 of those states required to provide medically accurate information? Most of the government funded schools in America can just say whatever the hell they want, if they even choose to say anything at all."}
{"src": "Why are shows like Dr.Oz allowed to give out health advice that isn't scientifically supported? How isn't this considered illegal?", "trg": " > How isn't this considered illegal? Because there's no such thing as \"considered illegal.\" Something is either illegal or it isn't. Expressing your opinion is protected by the First Amendment. The government has a little leeway when it comes to fraud, but it's very difficult to make it illegal for someone to say something in the United States."}
{"src": "What is the difference between energy attained from sleeping and energy attained from food?", "trg": "You don't get energy from sleeping. Your body gets energy from food. What sleep does is repair damage to your body and allow your brain to rest. When your brain doesn't have enough rest, it stops working as efficiently. But without food, your body won't have enough energy to do anything. Think of food as the gas you put into your car, and sleep as the occasional oil change you need to keep your car working properly."}
{"src": "Why is \"cause of death\" public record? Does our medical right of privacy end when we die?", "trg": "You've gotten a lot of really bad answers here. The reason \"cause of death\" like in a police report is public information is because **police reports** are public information. \"Cause of death\" as in a report on what killed your relative by a medical doctor at a hospital where they were treated is still protected under [HIPAA]( URL_0 ). The short answer answer is it depends on the source and relatives are free to disclose whatever they want."}
{"src": "If the flu shot contains a non-active version of the flu, then why are \"flu like symptoms\" common for the days following?", "trg": "the non-active proteins trigger an immune system response which can involve some inflammatory system responses. once the immune system is activated for that infection your body will react more readily if the actual infection gets into you."}
{"src": "How do you get job experience when you can't get a job with no experience?", "trg": "You apply anyways. Write a cover letter. Did you do anything in school that applies to this job directly? Boom. Experience. Do anything you can to get an interview. Most jobs are just trying to scare off people with unbelievable expectations."}
{"src": "why is there a \"terms and conditions\" for using a website or program, but not for more 'real life' things like eating at a restaurant?", "trg": "Walmart has them. They are usually in the back of the store and basically they give you a 'license' to shop there but not do things like write down their prices for competitors. I'm not sure how legally binding it is."}
{"src": "what stops insurgents from just mortering FOBs all day and night?", "trg": "We have mortars too. And a lot of other military equipment. If insurgents set up shop and start lobbing shells we're going to find them pretty quickly and shoot back. And we're a lot more accurate than they are."}
{"src": "Is there a reason that animals do not try and reproduce with other species?", "trg": "first of all, they do. Ducks try a lot. There are species of flowers that release pheromones of female wasps/bees to attract males and trick the males into pollinating. Dolphins do all kinds of things. Secondly, most animals have behaviors specific to their species, mating behaviors, chemical scents, physical signals, etc specifically so the animals avoid such confusions because wasted mating is wasted food/energy/risk"}
{"src": "How exactly did the older generations have it easier than us?", "trg": "One of the benefits that baby boomers enjoyed was a massive increase in the number of people with college degrees and increases in public education.That coupled plenty of jobs and new manufacturing meant there were plenty of jobs. Now college education is considered a minimum even for jobs that don't require it. And the number of jobs is decreasing due to automation and other efficiencies."}
{"src": "Why the temperature going up 2\u00b0 Celsius (or about 3.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit) is going to break the entire planet, and why we can't filter carbon out of the air", "trg": "It's not going to break the planet. Part of the reason I can sympathize with climate change deniers is because of how people dramatize the whole situation. We can absolutely adapt to the new environment. It won't be ideal but we won't all die out like some people will lead you to believe."}
{"src": "What does ONE bitcoin look like to a computer? And why can it not be just copied like a simple file?", "trg": "It's a series of numbers. And you can copy it, but you can still only spend it once because the transaction ledger- the list of which wallets sent which bitcoins to which other wallets- is public. It's not like spending a Bitcoin physically removes the data from your computer and sends it in a tube to the other computer. It's just that you need the other machines mining bitcoins to verify your transaction and they won't verify it if you try to spend it twice."}
{"src": "How does blood circulate through your body after you've had an amputation?", "trg": "Follow up question: Say you lose a leg in a car accident.

{"src": "How does blood circulate through your body after you've had an amputation?", "trg": "Question has been answered, but: I'm still curious to if a \"high pressure\" artery like the thigh artery (femoral) is cut near the hip, couldn't the shortened \"stop\" influence vessel pressure and burst capillaries nearby? As this \"thicker\" region of the artery has no natural end-point branching as in a \"full leg\"? Double-whammy: Could an amputation of a whole limb, say a leg, increase the blood pressure, or for instance hemoglobin levels, of a patient in any significant way?"}
{"src": "Why do people's stomach look bloated when they're malnourished?", "trg": "That's called *kwashiorkor*, and it happens when there's not enough protein in a person's diet. Protein in the blood keeps water bound in blood, and if there's not enough protein then the water leaks out into the tissues, mostly in the stomach and abdominal area."}
{"src": "why does rain in the tropics come down heavy for an hour and then vanish, but in europe the rain is mostly light and can last all day?", "trg": "Rain in the tropics is normally air mass thunderstorms and other downpours from vertical convection (heating at the surface causing air to rise). I think you're imagining Western Europe. In Western Europe the Atlantic is so warm it provides warmth to the land in Fall, Spring, and Winter--the tradeoff of supplying that warmth is steady, misty moisture as the warm moist air condenses on the cooler land."}
{"src": "Why does adding one methyl group to Adderall change it from being a common prescription medication to an extremely hard drug?", "trg": "The methyl group makes methamphetamine more lipophilic \\(Fat soluble\\) which allows it to get through the blood brain barrier much easier than adderall can. A more detailed overview on the differences between the two can be found [here]( URL_0 ) if you're so inclined. edit: oops forgot I was in ELI5. ELI5: Meth dissolves better in fats than adderall so when there is a barrier made of fats \\(blood brain barrier, membranes in general\\) it gets through it easier and faster."}
{"src": "How come no country has invaded the United States since the Revolutionary War?", "trg": "Uh, Pearl Harbor?

{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "There's not much force coming from those collisions. Force is the product of mass and acceleration. With such low mass, the speed would need to be increased tremendously to cause damage to its relatively strong exoskeleton."}
{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "They are small, hence very small inertia, so the bone-breaking force that applies to humans running into walls (~I'm guessing for a 75kg man like 130kg of force) doesn't really apply to flies as they are like less than 2 grams. So it's like 3g force"}

{"src": "The Bioshock universe", "trg": "I couldn't sum it up any better than the [wikipedia link.]( URL_0 ) I think this is what you want to know. Besides, the Bioshock games, though they share a common universe, are two separate stories with two separate leads (not counting Bioshock 2 which is still unrelated to Infinite).

{"src": "News agencies generally follow a standard to not report news of suicides due to copycats. Why hasn't a similar standard been established for reporting gun shootings?", "trg": "Suicides usually aren't really \"news\" unless the person is famous. Shootings are usually more newsworthy. If there's a murderer on the loose in your city, that's probably something the public should be aware of. And a mass shooting is definitely news."}

There are many theories, some more prevalent than others, but we really don\u2019t know. When is something we can measure. Studies in children show that by 48 months, almost all start to display a firm preference for one-handed or one-sided activities.

Look it up and you can see how to make or buy a small apparatus to do it. Fill two test tubes with the resulting gasses and you can measure the volume of gas, showing that the hydrogen tube has twice the volume of the oxygen tube. You can test the properties of the gasses (explode the Hydrogen, use the Oxygen to make something burn brighter, etc.)"}
{"src": "why doesn't tin foil feel hot to the touch even while it is in the oven or on a grill?", "trg": "Since aluminum foil has a lot of surface area and is very thin and heat travels within aluminum very well, it is going to cool off very quickly in air when you remove it from the oven. In addition, since thin foil doesn't weigh much and thus can't hold much\"heat,\" when you touch it not much heat can transfer to your fingers and thus it doesn't feel particularly warm."}
{"src": "My Daughter asked me what condensation is, I tried I explaining but she didn't understand. I need a genuine ELI5 on what condensation is.", "trg": "Water is made up of tiny little pieces called molecules, and when those molecules are warm and excited they dance so hard that they fly up into the air. It\u2019s like an invisible dance party happening all around us. But if those excited, dancing molecules become cold by, for example, touching a cold window, they stop dancing and grab onto each other like people do when they get cold. They become liquid water again until they warm up, let go of each other, and dance up into the air again."}
{"src": "How do holocaust deniers legitimize their viewpoint?", "trg": "They don't. They simply ignore evidence or dismiss it without basis. Some people mistakenly believe that simply arguing something is evidence of truth....as though facts get voted on.

However even though the term rape sounds more sinister they are both treated the same way in court."}
{"src": "Why is two weeks notice traditional when quitting? Why not longer/shorter?", "trg": "You're right that it's not long enough to replace a skilled worker. But in many jobs, it's enough to smoothly offload your duties onto one of the current workers. For some skilled trades where there's a ready labor pool, it may well be enough to find a replacement. Also, many social conventions just evolve because they work, without any serious analysis. But in some cases, particularly executives, it's common to give much more notice."}

{"src": "Cisgender", "trg": "The other answers are overcomplicated and not entirely correct. Basically a cisgender person is someone who self-identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth. In even simpler terms: if your birth certificate said either male or female and now that you're old enough to consider it, you basically agree with that, then you are cisgender. The rage is about a bunch of people saying that what you think you are doesn't matter, only the gender assigned at your birth is truly important."}
{"src": "how come when I get down really low, rub my fingers together and say \"psspsspsspss\" nearly all cats will come to me?", "trg": "Any kind of scratching noises attract them because it sounds like a mouse. Getting low to the ground makes you less threatening and smaller - notice how they run away when you stand up at your full height. Holding your fingers out makes you less threatening because they can come close and smell you to learn your scent, and by staying at the limit of your reach they're safe from being picked up suddenly."}
{"src": "how come when I get down really low, rub my fingers together and say \"psspsspsspss\" nearly all cats will come to me?", "trg": "The \"psspsspsspss\" is a relatively new noise that gets their attention, rubbing your fingers together makes them think you have something, being low means that they can easily reach whatever you may have."}

Being able to play all the Microsoft games without having to deal with shitty ports, and just having to spend maybe $100-200 on the software/hardware (disc drive) to have your PC have an Xbox mode? I'd be in love."}
{"src": "Why are teacher and police unions so much stronger than other unions?", "trg": "They are occupations which can't be outsourced, must provide services where ever people live, and must increase in number as the population increases. As the population rises, you must have more teachers and police. There's no way around it. Also, being public sector unions, they help elect their bosses."}

{"src": "Why do some morbidly obese people smell like moldy gym socks?", "trg": "There is often a psychological factor, too. Morbidly obese people are seldom happy, and often chronically depressed.

{"src": "Why was the historical development of beer more important than that of other alcoholic beverages?", "trg": "IIRC there is even a theory that we became farmers (instead of hunter gatherers) for beer.

Mormonism was also pretty obviously made up relatively recently, but once these things pick up some momentum people get caught up in it.

{"src": "If a cat is an \"outside\" cat, why does it return home and not go to another home?", "trg": "It's all about food and survival. When coroners find people that die in their homes with no one noticing, dogs will cuddle up next to their owners until they die too. Cats will start eating the owners face."}
{"src": "Why are Conspiracies typically dismissed without investigation?", "trg": "There is a saying popularised by Carl Sagan which states \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof\". Most conspiracy theorys fail to provide such proof, instead relying on hearsay or laymans opinion."}

{"src": "After detecting a missile launch, how does a country know if it's an attack or just a test?", "trg": "Typically a test is anouncwd via an international NOTAM: Notice To Airman. When a launch is detected without a NOTAM, all hell breaks loose to track where it's going. Once that's determined then decissions are made made based on the preliminary trajectory. Needless to say, getting it right, with typically no more than 20 minutes of time to decide, is the money shot!"}
{"src": "Why do cats always stretch their front legs before walking up to you?", "trg": "I always assumed that they were acting disinterested in me and my pats because they didn't wanna seem submissive to me calling them to come to me. I thought this because I have met cats that wanna run right up to you and meow and rub without any stretching."}
{"src": "How are buffets profitable? How much money is usually made (on average) per customer at all you can eat buffets? Do customers often eat more than the costs it took to serve them?", "trg": "Buffets are profitable because: * the food is usually lower quality * they can get by with fewer staff * it is cheaper to prepare the food in bulk, instead of cooking plating it per order EDIT: By lower quality, I don't mean crappy. I mean vegetables vs. meat, chicken vs. beef, store bought vs. homemade."}

Do customers often eat more than the costs it took to serve them?", "trg": "I own and operate a \"by-the-pound\" buffet and being able to buy in bulk saves a ton of money. I buy 200 pounds of chicken on Monday because Tuesday is soul food day. It's easier and cheaper than buying 50 pounds of chicken that you have to prepare individually for a table that is served by a waiter. My profit margins are great because it's by the pound. People come in, they put food on their tray, they pay, and leave."}
{"src": "How are buffets profitable? How much money is usually made (on average) per customer at all you can eat buffets? Do customers often eat more than the costs it took to serve them?", "trg": "most buffets make money by buying the cheapest food possible in the biggest quantity possible, and then charge $2 bucks per glass of pop. also, i like how nearly every post in this thread has been hit by what i presume to by the Downvote Brigade, /r/ELI5 Battalion, NA(for North America) Company, American Platoon. lol EDIT: Fixed my unit reference."}
{"src": "How are buffets profitable? How much money is usually made (on average) per customer at all you can eat buffets? Do customers often eat more than the costs it took to serve them?", "trg": "It seems like the food is lower quality than ordering off the menu. Also a lot of people suck at the art of knocking back four or five plates of food and will pay $15+ for the buffet and get one plate of food, when in reality they could have had the $5 appetizer and been full."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "They're in contact with bodily fluids far more often than you or I would be. They take precautions, sure, but when you deal with something that frequently unlikely things can happen. EDIT - I should have also mentioned something about fatigue and how it can cause individual lapses in safety protocols. This probably contributes pretty heavily, too."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "Doctors Without Borders: 700 served. Infected: 4. So maybe good old fashioned accidental, and most likely due to sleep deprivation. Add to that these 700 doctors are not working in state of the art facilities."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "It essentially boils down to human error. The medical staff so something procedurally wrong and end up infected. The virus isn't infecting them through the gear. The doctors are messing up so that it's like the gear isn't there."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "As a health care professional, I see people on a daily basis wiping their face off/touching light switches/brushing away their hair/all kinds of other things with contaminated gloves. With ebola, it takes one \"oops!\" to be infected."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "Direct contact with bodily fluids includes folk with Ebola coughing and ejecting an aerosol cloud of viral laden micro drops all over the place. These are humid countries they are coming from in Africa too. Being constantly covered head to toe in layers of scrubs is brutal, and I imagine they just get fatigued and make mistakes."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "Same reason why professional drivers get in more accidents per year then non-professional drivers - they're around it more. They might be less likely than the average citizen, thanks to the medical equipment you mention, but they're more likely because they're dealing with ebola more frequently."}
{"src": "If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?", "trg": "In an extremely ELI5, it's not very contagious, but extremely infectious. Meaning it's not easy to be in contact with something contagious, but the things that are contagious can very easily infect you."}
{"src": "Why are most third world countries in warmer areas of the world?", "trg": "There was a scientific trend in the past called Material Determinism that attempted to explain that the tropical regions were not as developed for reasons such as being warmer and thus making people lazy. This theory has been discredited a long time ago. There is no causation, even if there is some correlation."}

If you choose not to have your child vaccinated then you sign a form saying you object to vaccines for personal or religious reasons. Schools know which students are not vaccinated for which diseases and can bar them from attending school during an outbreak.

{"src": "If \"the oceans are running out of fish\" why doesn't the price of fish go up significantly? (or at all?)", "trg": "Let's say that 1000 fish are caught each month, the total population of fish is 10000, and the population is replenished at a rate of 500/month. The population of fish is obviously declining and at the current rate will eventually perish, but at the moment that has no effect on the supply of fish in the market, which is still 1000/month."}
{"src": "A long time ago, a person was able to work 40 hours a week and support a family. Today two people need to work 40 hours a week to barely support themselves living together. What changed?", "trg": "Stagnating wages, skyrocketing cost of living, poor transportation and heavy traffic make the less-expensive suburbs very difficult to live in while working in the city. A huge increase in tuition costs resulting in everyone in their 20s being sacked with tens of thousands of dollars of debt."}
{"src": "A long time ago, a person was able to work 40 hours a week and support a family. Today two people need to work 40 hours a week to barely support themselves living together. What changed?", "trg": "A variety of things changed but a major factor is the expectations of what you should expect from life. People needed less money in the past because they had lower expectations of standard of living compared to now. Things a family in 1970 didn't spend money on: computers, video game systems, multiple cars, personal tvs, multiple phones, cable tv, and probably more that I can't think of offhand."}

{"src": "What happens when a police officer pulls someone over who doesn't speak english?", "trg": "I don't know about other places, but in the UK, they can phone an interpreter. The phone gets passed between the officer and the person they've stopped, and the interpreter translated for each of them in turn.

{"src": "I see kids that are younger and younger with glasses every day. How do they measure how they can see and how bad their eyes are when it's literally a baby that can't even walk or talk, let alone read letters aloud from an eye exam?", "trg": "Some eye ailments are very obvious. I was born with crossed eyes (strabismus) and had corrective surgery at a few months. I was wearing eyeglasses before I could walk. I still need to wear glasses, but my eyesight is very good. You would never know my eyes used to be crossed."}

{"src": "What is causing the escalating situation in Israel and Palestine?", "trg": "The major problem is that everyone in the world wants this to be explained to them like they're five. It's just not that simple. Neither party is the righteous hero in this situation. It's a really intricate, nuanced issue."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "If you think of your immune system as your body's military, pus is basically a battlefield after a battle -- it's a giant pile of the corpses of white blood cells (your body's soldiers) and the bacteria they were sent to fight. It's indicative that your body's military force is intervening and taking care of the problem, but if the pile of corpses gets too big, that might indicate that your side is getting overwhelmed by the bacteria."}
{"src": "If the Food and Drug Administration is so particular about the well-being of the consumers, why is tobacco legal?", "trg": "A big issue also revolves around freedom of choice. There's a fine line between making something illegal because it's dangerous and making something illegal because it's bad for you. People have the right to chose how they want to live their lives.

{"src": "Why does the auto industry hate that Tesla sells directly to the customer instead of going through a dealer?", "trg": "Since nobody's mentioned this - there are laws that specifically prevent automakers from selling directly to consumers. So it's really a case of \"no fair, if Elon gets to do it why can't I?\". And they have a very valid point."}
{"src": "How do we not kill off bees by harvesting their honey? Don\u2019t they need the honey to survive the winter?", "trg": "My dad gave some local bee conservation people permission to put a few hives on his property, and one of the hives was started too close to winter and/or wasn't doing as well as the first, and they had to supplement it by putting honey into it so the bees could survive the winter or have enough honey once spring arrived. But apparently once the hives are established they produce enough honey that he will get some free honey out of the deal."}
{"src": "How does this vinegar/baking soda hot ice reaction work?", "trg": "That's not freezing. It's *nucleation*, which in this case is basically building crystals. The bit of residue on the skewer gives a point for the solid in the solution to stick to, and what's shown in the GIF is the solute building a big crystal around the skewer."}
{"src": "Olympics are almost never profitable, why would countries spend billions on it?", "trg": "National pride is huge. And it's easy to sell it as a big, world shaping event. When done well, it can be profitable, but few places do it well. Toss in a good dose of bribes and political pandering and you've got yourself a recipe for economic disturbances of olympic proportions."}
{"src": "Why are SSNs so damn insecure?", "trg": "Because social security (the people that issue the numbers) don't really care they just needed a unique identifier for working citizens. It doesn't even really need to be that secure for what they are doing. It's every body else that is piggybacking on this poor identifying system that gives it the ability to ruin your life."}
{"src": "How is it that very complex 10-hour seasons of TV shows can be produced in a year's time, yet 2-hour movies so often take years to produce?", "trg": "A lot of it is setup that takes place before any production begins - hiring people, finding actors, locations, etc. A tv show has to do that just once - just like in movies, except they get to reuse all of those resources in every episode."}
{"src": "Why do we forget what happened in our dreams the following morning?", "trg": "If you want to remember, keep a journal near your bed and immediately scribble out whatever you can recall as soon as you wake up. It will be easier to remember them over time.... Plus it can be pretty entertaining to read on a rainy day."}
{"src": "Do dogs understand their names, or do they just think it's a command meaning \"come here\" or \"look at me\"?", "trg": "A theory is in fact they actually attenuate the name you give them to more or less something that they relate with when someone addresses them. They don't have the concept of ownership and self though, so basically they know the word means you are speaking to them but they have no concept of what names are."}
{"src": "[kinda old] What was carmaggedon?", "trg": "One of the busiest freeways in LA (possibly the country/world) was closed for 2.5 days, creating traffic problems. Gov't entities were telling celebrities who lived in LA to tweet about it and try to get the word out so people could plan ahead and try to keep traffic to a minimum during the shutdown. I never heard anything about it after it happened (I live in WV, USA) so I'm not sure how it all turned out."}
{"src": "Why does UK English just say \"in hospital\" when US English says \"in THE hospital\"?", "trg": "When you drop a/the, you're implying that the next word is a transitive state. In denial, in grief, in school, etc.; it's a state of being. So in hospital would imply he's in the state of being treated, while 'in the hospital' has more emphasis on WHERE he is. I'm sure someone can explain it more technically correct, but you can see there's a difference plainly between the two, rather than just a difference in dialect."}
{"src": "How can a side affects of antidepressants be thoughts of suicide?", "trg": "Side effects are things that you are likely to experience while taking the drug, as determined by what was reported by people using the drug during clinical trials. They're not all necessarily *caused* by the drug. Thoughts of suicide are commonly reported by people who are depressed, and antidepressants aren't 100% effective, so it's not unreasonable to assume that the thoughts of suicide are just an aspect of depression that is not wholly alleviated by the medicine."}
{"src": "What's the difference between browsing and downloading on the Web? My understanding is that content gets downloaded to your computer in both the cases, so what's the catch here.", "trg": "When you browse, your browser downloads the pages to some temporary place. You're right that it's downloading the content. But when you leave the page the browser will delete the content because you're no longer looking at it (not necessarily right away but that's not important). When you download something from the web, you're saving it to a place of your choosing, usually outside of your browser's control. When you leave the page your browser won't delete that thing you downloaded."}
{"src": "Why do the Air Force One pilots get switched with every president?", "trg": "When I was 6 or so, I met the Air Force One pilot for George W Bush. The pilot gave me a box of peanut M & Ms with the American seal on it and the president's personal signature on it in sharpie, next to the printed signature. I ripped it open, ate it and threw it away. Apparently stuff with his actual signature is worth around $300 now. Drat."}
{"src": "Why the illuminati and 2012 new world order conspiracies are so popular", "trg": "I think the 2012 stuff is so popular because not many people really know much about Mayan culture and technology and also because it is currently 2011. No one cares about the Swiss doomsday theory of 3045."}

{"src": "How is being dyslexic in symbol languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) different from being dyslexic in English?", "trg": "My understanding is that there are many, many types of dyslexias, too numerous and can exhibit themselves in various intensity. While phonemic processing may be one type that some dyslexics suffer less with iconographic scripts, there are others (ex. difficulty navigating through tables) that they would do rather badly in, regardless of what language type is used."}
{"src": "What is PRISM?", "trg": "Sorry if this is a stupid question, but it's always bothered me when issues like data collection pops up. Would each company have its own proprietary ways to save data, that would make it incompatible with the data from other companies? How does the government deal with this?"}
{"src": "What's happening in Thailand?", "trg": "Every single year there is some kind of unrest or natural disaster. It tends to even itself out. Tourists aren't ever really affected unless the airport shuts down (which it has before). Just stay out of the pre-determined protest areas."}
{"src": "Why do people hold their heads when something surprising/unbelievable happens? Is this a defence mechanism?", "trg": "Subconscious body language. Your mind has less control over your feet and hands. You can read someone's emotions by their feet and hands just like when someone is stopping them self from saying something, they put their hand over their mouth. They are shocked and don't want to see something, they cover their face/eyes."}
{"src": "How come eyebrow, eyelash, arm hairs, ect only grow to a certain point, but when you shave them they grow back? How does it know it's been shaved? Why don't they continuously grow like head hair?", "trg": "There are different types of hair-vellus, terminal, androgenic affected pubic hairs-each is given more or less support and bloodow by the cells beneath the skin. That hair has its own timetable for turnover-and will grow its rate of growth for however many weeks, months, years, then it will rest and shed. That length of time creates the hair's terminal length."}
{"src": "why is Hurricane Patricia considered a hurricane when its coming from the Pacific Ocean. Wouldn't be regarded as a Typhoon? Or does it have to due with where it makes landfall?", "trg": "Has to do with Longitudes **Edit** and Agencies. from 140\u00b0W longitude to 180\u00b0W longitude the storms are called hurricanes, and they are monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. past 180\u00b0W in the pacific they are called a typhoon and they are monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as well as the Japan Meteorological Agency **EDIT** I have no idea where the Cyclone Vs Typhoon split is.

{"src": "If you are still conscious for several seconds after being decapitated, what would be happening physiologically? Would you instinctively breathe even though you wouldn't need to?", "trg": "For starters, you breathe using your chest/abdomen, so your severed head wouldn't be breathing. If conscious, your brain would be panicking trying to send signals to your lungs \"breathe in! Come on! Breathe!\""}

{"src": "What's happening when you take a pill, but it feels like it's caught in the back of your throat?", "trg": "I don't know but i always take my pills with food and water. In my experience its actually just the sensation of the pill scratching the back of your throat its not actually stuck. so eating helps get rid of that sensation. water makes sure you swallow the pill properly."}
{"src": "Why do I get sleepy after reading 2 hours or studying but my scumbag brain can play Skyrim all night without getting tired?", "trg": "Have you considered you just might be reading the wrong books? I read all of the time. Some books I could read all day and night, finish, and immediately re-read. I will never get tired of them. Other books will put me to sleep before I'm 100 pages in.

{"src": "If I bake a cake today with milk that'll expire tomorrow, will my cake also expire tomorrow or has the expiration been nullified?", "trg": "The expiration date from the milk is no longer relevant. Your cake will have the same shelf regardless of whether you used milk expiring tomorrow, or milk expiring much later, because you have killed all the bacteria that were going to make the milk spoil."}
{"src": "We all know light travels 186,282 miles per second. But HOW does it travel. What provides its thrust to that speed? And why does it travel instead of just sitting there at its source?", "trg": "You're getting a lot of over complicated answers here, so I will be brief. Photons have no mass, that's just how they are. It's an intrinsic property of photons in the same what that the density of a material is always the same. Since they have no mass, they have no inertia as you would expect given Newtons equation F=ma. This means you need exactly zero force to make a photon move at the speed of light."}
{"src": "Why can't we replace limbs like we replace organs?", "trg": "We can reattach a severed limb, and in limited cases transplant one. However, connecting the nerves is extremely hard, and most people don't want a new leg that they cannot walk on, or a new hand that can't pick anything up or feel anything."}

But they're pretty wheelchair accessible, with only additional living space (cells) in upper levels. I've rarely seen steps into buildings.

If I dance at a memorial no one looks twice."}
{"src": "Why do celebrities rarely get prison sentences that match the severity of those given to non-celebrities?", "trg": "It mostly comes down to money. It's the same reason why white collar criminals can steal millions and walk away with a small fine or a few months in a minimum security resort prison. They can afford good lawyers, while the standard street criminal cannot afford good counsel, and are stuck with inexperienced, overwork, and often uninterested public defenders."}
{"src": "If 1 burger takes 1300 gallons of fresh water to produce, how can I buy them for under $5.00?", "trg": "I guess whatever you-betcha formula was used to arrive at 1300 gallons was carefully averaged for water costs. Where I'm at (Fraser Valley) unlimited fresh water is available from my wells for free. Come to think of it, this makes the amount of water my cows drink one of the few things I don't know about them. It's a shit ton though, so maybe 1300 gallons is low."}
{"src": "Why is men's sport watched so so much more than women's?", "trg": "Because womens is the same but slightly dialed back.

Our economy relies on breaking up family groups. It keeps the economy moving. People pay more for things like housing, childcare, transportation. When the reality is that it makes much more sense to do exactly the opposite and build family groups so that financial and other responsibilities are shared."}

{"src": "How come some people can cry on demand, yet some people can't even after major trauma (Physical/Emotional)", "trg": "When people experience major trauma, pain and tears may not be the first response for everyone. Most often the first emotion from trauma is either fear, or shock. There's adrenaline associated with the former, and disassociation with the latter. Victims of trauma can continue to perpetuate either that state of fear, or shock, because it often feels better than the internalization of facing inner pain associated with the trauma."}

{"src": "Why Google Chrome tabs can consume up to 100-150 megabytes of memory while many of them consist just of kilobytes of javascript?", "trg": "The amount of memory JavaScript needs has little to do with the size of the code. The code can ask for more memory in loops, consider the instructions: DECLARE something as ARRAYLIST while( 1 equals 1 ) { Add one item to something } (Note code is not actually JavaScript). This would use all the memory in existence and it can be measured in bytes."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "Bone does not isolate sound good at all, rather it's very good at transmitting sound, so the sound waves reach your ear through the skull and jaw bone (which connects to the skull just by the ear). From the rest of the body though, there are too many joints providing insolation so the vibrations can't really reach your ear, so you will not hear much more than what's going on in your head."}

{"src": "What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country? Why are they doing this?", "trg": "The recurring theme of Russia's entire history is access to warm water ports. Regardless of whatever else happens, Russia is as likely to give up it's Naval Base on the Black sea as the US is to give up it's Naval Base in Cuba. Never. Happening. Ever. My opinion is that the only way Ukraine gets out of this in one piece is to give Russia sovereignty over it's naval base in Crimea."}

{"src": "What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country? Why are they doing this?", "trg": "It's worth remembering that Putin's power base absolutely requires him to maintain a tough guy image.

{"src": "What does Russia have to gain from invading such a poor country? Why are they doing this?", "trg": "Everyone is claiming this is about the ports but I think that's wrong. It's about National prestige and pipelines. Natural Gas Lines to Europe run through the Crimea. If Ukraine and Crimea flip blue, Russia will lose some control over it's gas exports."}
{"src": "Why is the United States so hesitant with Stem Cell treatment when it, so clearly, could revolutionize modern medicine as we know it?", "trg": "There might be the feeling that once stem cell treatment becomes common place, there will be a larger demand for embryos.

How is it profitable for a company to pay it and why is it offered?", "trg": "In the US, hours worked over 40 in the defined work week must be paid at time and a half. Some states, CA, require overtime pay after 8 hours in a day. It is more efficient to pay overtime because additional employees cost more to train, onboard, recruit. Employer would have to pay more in benefits and employer tax as well. It's easier to manage a smaller team as well. And there are many more factors relating to labor I haven't mentioned."}
{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "I have noticed that Google doesn't do this anymore.

Is it possible that it's actually just a really big but finite number?", "trg": "It's in the same vein as why 1/3 isn't a 'finite number' when converted to decimal (0.33333... repeating forever), there is technically a \"definite\" number that pi is, it is just not possible to represent it completely accurately in the system of numbers we use. So we use the pi symbol to represent it, like we represent 0.3333... as 1/3."}

I've experienced it five times in my adult life and it is the same every time. You wake up wondering where they're going to start the surgery.

When you do this it becomes very difficult to keep water by the roots as the surrounding would will retain it out of reach. Saturation across all the medium of the larger pot will create a situation where the plant is being over watered/fed. Because of this, many sources recommend stepping up in pot size to the desired result."}

{"src": "How raising minimum wage to $15/hour would effect someone who is not rich, but who already makes more than $15/hour", "trg": "Just to add one thing. Companies are less likely to hire lower skilled workers when they are forced to pay them more.

Why do Red Sox fans form bubbles when surrounded by Yankee fans, but Yankee fans form a continuous line?"}
{"src": "Why did we evolve to rely on sleep rather than being awake 24/7?", "trg": "evolution is not a force towards the optimum, it's a force towards the minimum necessary. for example, if grass was poisonous, it would be better for its survival, as less animals would come eat it. But if grass is not poisonous, and it survives to the next generation regardless, then it didn't need to be poisonous to live, so it won't evolve that trait."}
{"src": "Why aren't there any mammals with green fur considering there is so much green in the natural world?", "trg": "Giving this my best shot: The hair colouring is decided by the chemical structures that make it up. Depending on the ratios of two chemicals (eumelanin and pheomelanin) hair colours range from black through brown, red, and into white. There just isn't a colour in there for green and there isn't much of a selective pressure to have such a colour in mammals. The colours we have are good enough."}

I understand that one is intended to be kept as a pet and one is for feeding to large snakes and reptiles, but why would there be a difference?", "trg": "I am not an expert but it\u2019s probably just marketing. It\u2019s a lot easier to sell a rat as a snack for a snake when they\u2019re only $8 compared to $30. And when you try to buy a rat as a pet, $30 seems reasonable for a companion."}

{"src": "why is car insurance mandatory, but mandatory health insurance is \"unconstitutional\"?", "trg": "Because driving a car is, legally,a privilege, not a right, it is regulate d by the states, and the insurance rules are part of that regulation, and the US Constitution doesn't deny this power to states. ACA is a Federal program and does not reflect specific provisions of the Constitution. If a state went to a public option and made it mandatory, it would likely not be challengeable in Federal unless an argument were made the ACA or other Federal laws have supremacy."}
{"src": "why is car insurance mandatory, but mandatory health insurance is \"unconstitutional\"?", "trg": "It's this simple: If it's not specified in the Constitution, it's a state issue.

{"src": "in the USA, why are wait staff tipped a percentage of the food bill, rather than a flat rate?", "trg": "Waiters are basically salesmen, and tips are basically their commission.

But what makes them useful is that the proteins in the egg white unfold and bind to each other when heated, congealing from liquid to a jelly-like solid. Thus, adding egg whites to a recipe is like adding a non-toxic (and actually quite nutritious) glue that will hold together whatever the other ingredients are."}

Does anyone out there really not know about it at this point?", "trg": "I'm actually very disappointed that \"public awareness\" doesn't seem to give a shit about skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, bone marrow cancer in comparison. I wonder what the funding/charity disparity is."}
{"src": "The difference and jurisdiction between police, sheriffs, state police, FBI, highway patrol; who handles what?", "trg": "It's area based mainly.. Police have jurisdiction inside the city limits.. Sheriffs Deputies have jurisdiction inside the county..

{"src": ". How can I sit in a ~200\u00b0 F sauna and not get burned, but water the same temperature spilled on my arm will burn and blister my skin?", "trg": "The difference is how air and water TRANSFER heat. Air is a fairly poor at transmitting heat. It is at a very high temperature but it does not transfer that temperature to your skin. Water is about 30 times better at transferring heat. The high temperature goes right into your skin and burns. It's the reverse of why standing naked in 50 degree air will be cold but bearable for maybe half an hour, but jump into 50 degree water and you'll be unconscious from cold in a few minutes."}
{"src": "Why do so many cultures wear the western suit as their formal wear?", "trg": "Europeans (and later Americans) have had a large amount of influence on the entire world.

{"src": "Why are window screens so uncommon throughout much of the tropical world?", "trg": "I traveled across tropical countries and this was also the case, even super rich people didn't have screens. Insects, lizards, rodents, and even cats came through the windows. The people just deal with it as part of life. Most of the places I went to didn't have glass windows either, just wooden shutters, and most buildings are not made of wood. Attaching sliding screens might be difficult."}
{"src": "Why are window screens so uncommon throughout much of the tropical world?", "trg": "Window screens are virtually unheard of in South American countries. Source: lived there for a while. It's not a money issue, people just don't buy it. When they do, they buy netting for their beds. They do buy a lot of moth balls though. But over there they're called \"alcanfor\"."}
{"src": "Based on the financial success and cult-following of the original \"Super Troopers\", why are studios opting out of financing a sequel?", "trg": "From what I may understand they had massive difficulties getting people to support the first movie. Despite its success, I think they felt the guys who ended up starring (and making it the most awesome movie as can be) weren't going to pull in money. They wanted more known actors to be stars rather than the Broken Lizard Crew. So perhaps this time around they decided to circumvent that cluster fuck and have the movie funded by people who truly want it to happen. IE: The people."}

If you google for its etymology you get this: Origin late 17th century: perhaps from Chinese (Cantonese dialect) k'\u0113 chap \u2018tomato juice\u2019.

{"src": "Why do airplanes load passengers front to back instead of back to front?", "trg": "JetBlue actually does load from the back, but that's because they don't offer as many upgrades to priority boarding or first class like United, Delta, and the rest of them do. Priority boarding is another opportunity to make money on seats. Edit. Not Southwest"}
{"src": "Why do some video games alt-tab quickly and other's take ages or even crash trying to reopen?", "trg": "I thought it came down to windowed borderless vs full screen. In full screen your GPU doesn't render Windows (the OS) so it has \"to make that switch\" but in windowed borderless, Windows is being rendered so it snappily asked shows up. That's how I've understood it. Might be wrong though."}
{"src": "Why are the ceilings in so many grocery stores so high?", "trg": "I can't believe no one has mentioned this, but taller ceilings also allow for more storage in the back without taking up as much sale floor space. Freight in is an accounting cost that may be higher then the utilities."}
{"src": "Do I even read anymore, or has my brain memorised all the words/patterns that I need and recognises it automatically ?", "trg": "There's some conflation going on here between language and *reading*. Language seems to be something that humans develop \"naturally\", as already mentioned. But *reading* isn't natural. And the system that we use, where graphemes (marks) represent phonemes (speech sounds), is always happening in our brains as we read. Studies have shown how fluent readers are still scanning words left to right, they are just very accomplished at it, so the feeling is of absorbing whole words."}
{"src": "How does carbonation aid with an upset stomach?", "trg": "To everyone saying it doesn't help- that is a narrow view. One sip of diet soda can help with nausea I sometimes get in the mornings. Sometimes I also get very nauseous along with the urge to sneeze. When I sneeze, the nausea is instantly gone. I've never met anyone else with the same symptoms."}
{"src": "Why do dogs go grey around the mouth? Do animals have \"beards\"?", "trg": "One of my dogs is going prematurely white. It seems to be sex linked as well, as all the females in her line go white early but the males don't. The fur on her face started turning white when she was 3 years old."}

It's just that we are surrounded by our propaganda so you don't get to see their propaganda. The most sophisticated and insidious propaganda are in the west. The simple, primitive and draconian propaganda are in backwards societies like north korea. But either way, we are just as brainwashed as those in north korea."}
{"src": "Why is turkey a more common cold cut for sandwiches than chicken, when chicken is a more popular meat?", "trg": "Because the traditional sandwich meat was ham, and turkey was the low fat substitute. Over time, turkey became equal to ham, and now, I would say the more popular choice. Chicken was never a ham substitute in a sandwich, so never needed to be processed as a cold cut to act as a replacement."}
{"src": "Why is turkey a more common cold cut for sandwiches than chicken, when chicken is a more popular meat?", "trg": "turkeys are big so they are more economical to gut and mince into sliceable geometric meat shapes by the cold cut factories. chickens are small so it would take more of them to mince ti get the same weight of meat, all fillers being equal. i prefer chicken, even in november."}
{"src": "How does sleep deprivation actually kill you?", "trg": "It probably can kill but to my knowledge no known case has been reported in humans. There was once a fairly cruel experiment where they put rats in very shallow water but deep enough to prevent them from falling asleep. They kept them in there until they died and later investigation it showed the had died of sepsis. It seems your body needs sleep to regulate its immune system so not sleeping for long periods of time can kill."}
{"src": "Why is the TV show \"Scrubs\" considered to be one of the most accurate medical themed shows?", "trg": "Creator Bill Lawrence leaned heavily on his college friend Dr. Jonathan Doris as the inspiration for the show, as well as a technical advisor. Combined with the fact that the show didn't use medical condition or treatments as a main plot device and I think we ended up with a more realistic show."}
{"src": "Why still no solution to baldness?", "trg": "Platelet Rich Plasma injections seem to be a step in the right direction regarding hairloss. We have finasteride which prevents the conversion of testosterone to DHT which is thought to be responsible for hair follicle miniaturization. There is potential for side effects that deter most people however. Minoxidil seems to help with blood flow to the follicles."}
{"src": "Why is it possible to understand a language when spoken to, yet not be able to speak it?", "trg": "It also helps that many words are similar on different languages so we are able to make a reasonable guess at their meaning. e.g. \"une banane\" is easily understood, but if someone was asked for the French word for banana was, they would not know."}
{"src": "If I were on the moon during a total lunar eclipse, and looked up at the Earth, what would I see? Why?", "trg": "You'd see something [like this]( URL_0 ). Because the earth has an atmosphere, you'd see a red ring around the earth. This would be the sunset/sunrise zone around the earth. The red sunset color is responsible for coloring the moon red during the eclipse [like this]( URL_2 ). Also you'd maybe see some of the corona of the sun radiating out from the sun.

{"src": "How are genders different than sexes and what do many different genders mean?", "trg": "As someone in my youth stated it: \"sex is between your legs, gender is between your ears\"; sex is what you physically are, while gender is what you think of yourself as. Although not without its limitations, it's a pretty good definition. When they are mismatched* It's like** having a (mostly)permanent job as a factory worker when all you wanted to do your whole life was farm. * gonna get crucified with that one. * * with how society in general perceives you."}
{"src": "How did the Dalit (Untouchable caste of India) originate and were they always oppressed?", "trg": "The British may not have created the caste system, but they enforced it. Long story short, they placed themselves at a higher rank of societial importance simply for being British, some may argue for being white. This created rife when the country attempted to reach Independence."}
{"src": "Why do other countries eat up American Entertainment and trends, but the opposite doesn't hold true for foreign entertainment in the U.S?", "trg": "One can drive in one direction for 36 hours in the US and never encounter a community where the predominant language is anything but English. They exist, but they're generally smaller border towns or neighborhoods in larger cities. In Europe a person might pass through three or four language regions in an 8 hour drive. We're just not accustomed to a multilingual world in the US, so Americans in general find dubbing or subtitles to be distracting."}
{"src": "Say I'm 70 years old, only got a few years left, what's stopping me from spending a lot of money and racking up a load of debt?", "trg": "Back in the early 90's when AIDS was in full swing this was a valid financial planning approach. When an otherwise healthy young man developed full blown AIDS he would acquire as much credit as possible and spend it on items that we easy to covert to cash. When he died his heirs (usually friends) would sell the items to pay for his funeral. The credit card companies would be left holding the bag."}

With enough individuals could we fuck over a bank?"}
{"src": "Say I'm 70 years old, only got a few years left, what's stopping me from spending a lot of money and racking up a load of debt?", "trg": "The only thing stopping you is finding people willing to give you money. In Switzerland unsecured consumer loans from banks or credit institutes are not done for retired people by law. Now if you find some poor private bastard to lend you some money you're all set. Your heirs on the other hand will inherit the debt. The can refuse to accept it though."}
{"src": "Why is charcoal so effective in fire places/pits/barbeque stands if the most of the wood/fuel has been used up?", "trg": "Wood burns in two stages: the hydrogen stage and the carbon stage. In the hydrogen stage, hydrocarbon molecules are broken and oxidise. In the carbon stage, the carbon oxidises. The carbon stage burning is a hotter and cleaner chemical reaction than hydrogen stage burning. Charcoal is made by burning wood in the hydrogen stage (hence removing the hydrocarbons) but not allowing the carbon stage (by limiting the amount of oxygen)."}
{"src": "How did adding \"Le-\" or \"De-\" to the beginning of a more traditional name become prominent in Black American culture?", "trg": "Well it's obvious that the US has a HUGE hangup about race/colour/ethnicity. In North Carolina they want to know your race when you apply for a fishing lisense! Of course its nothing to do with race; thats a concept that is obsolete anyway, we are all of the same race. And by the way where did the phrase 'caucasian' come from? It, like 'african-american', seems to be a concept that only exists in the USA."}
{"src": "Why can't a person with Alzheimer's have a fact sheet in front of them at all times reminding them of every truth about them, including the fact that they have Alzheimer's, and that they are expected to be constantly confused?", "trg": "Because it's not that they forgotten the information, it's that they can't process memory correctly. They essentially have been displaced in time. So even when presented with facts about their life, they wouldn't see them that way. Because they have no frame of reference for those memories."}
{"src": "Why can't a person with Alzheimer's have a fact sheet in front of them at all times reminding them of every truth about them, including the fact that they have Alzheimer's, and that they are expected to be constantly confused?", "trg": "I once treated a patient who's family would remind him that his wife had recently passed away and it destroyed him every time. It was their way of coping with it, not meant to be malicious in the slightest but it was still difficult to observe."}

Companies like Coke recognize this and exploit it. It might sound odd, however people are willing to pay more for a smaller coke because of personal preference. also this is capitalism."}
{"src": "Why is a 2 liter of Coca-cola $1, a 12 oz bottle $1.49 and the same size bottle of water $1.99?", "trg": "If its a warm two liter then its cheaper because all it takes is shelf space, and if its a cold 12oz then your paying for the \"privilege and connvience\" of it already being cold. The water probably has more to do with the process they use, in which they filter the water to distilled water and then add chemicals to make it taste \"natural\""}
{"src": "Why is a 2 liter of Coca-cola $1, a 12 oz bottle $1.49 and the same size bottle of water $1.99?", "trg": "In general terms, cost of goods for a company is cheaper on more mass produced items. There's certainly a point-of-purchase mark-up but this mark-up probably also includes the fact it costs more to make x times more small bottles than larger ones."}
{"src": "Therapy checkups", "trg": "This would actually be a brilliant idea. The thing is that mental health is often overlooked or underestimated. Even in welfare-societies such as Denmark where the good schools, universities (they actually pay you to study), healthcare and similar things are free (paid for by the government) you still have to pay to get psychiatric therapy unless you have a really big problem. It is a shame that it is that way."}
{"src": "Why does everything seem so interesting while I am procrastinating?", "trg": "If I had to take a stab in the dark at this, I'd say it's because when you do have something you need to get done, e.g. a paper, you indirectly look for things that will distract you from what you're supposed to be accomplishing. Your brain starts to perceive all these mundane things like cleaning your room as another way to get out of the task you need to do. Just my guess."}
{"src": "Why do truck wheels (the metal part) always go outwards in the front and inwards in the back", "trg": "If you mean a regular truck then they don't.

I mean, it may not function but on long term capitalism won't either.", "trg": "The rest of the world, being capitalist, is controlled by the capitalist ruling class. Communism calls for global revolt against the capitalist ruling class and the seizure of their property. They were afraid of this, because they like being so rich, so naturally they put a lot of effort into making people hate Communism. Simple."}

There are so many innumerable differences between UK health and US health. US is certainly a mess, but it is hard to pinpoint that to a single problem that it is not nationally paid for.

{"src": "Why do top nutrition advisory panels continue to change their guidelines (sometimes dramatically) on what constitutes a healthy diet?", "trg": "Don't discount the effect of powerful food lobbies.

This data is then used by researchers, cited to lawmakers, etc etc. The LESS flattering studies are buried forever."}
{"src": "Why do top nutrition advisory panels continue to change their guidelines (sometimes dramatically) on what constitutes a healthy diet?", "trg": "It's not just that the science is young when it comes to nutrition, young in capability to explain and predict the world (which is how you judge the quality of science) but also that scientific institutions are extremely slow to change in the face of new information."}
{"src": "Why do some judges in criminal cases sentence a defendant to \"two life sentences\"", "trg": "This can happen when there are multiple counts of a serious crime involved.

Cooking is useful for humans because it yields more energy. Here's a relevant [article]( URL_0 ) about the oldest pottery yet discovered."}
{"src": "Why are humans the only species of carnivores/omnivores that needs to heat raw meat before it's safe to consume?", "trg": "Cooking foods pre-digests food so it's easier for your body to absorb the nutrients without spending the energy to actually break it down. From what I understand, our brains use something like 25% of the body's energy. So we need the additional net calories to keep it running."}
{"src": "What are you actually \"seeing\"when you close your eyes and notice the swirls of patterns in the darkness behind your eyelids?", "trg": "As others point out, they are called phosphenes. What causes them, in very basic terms, is stimulation of the retina using means other than light. You can get them from applying pressure to your eyes, like when you rub them. Electricity, extreme magnetism, and even subatomic particles striking the retina can cause them. The retinas are designed to be stimulated by light, but because they are so sensitive, other things can stimulate them as well."}
{"src": "Why does the general population see CEOs as greedy and not deserving of their salaries, while not criticizing actors, athletes, and musicians who make just as much if not more as CEOs nearly as much.", "trg": "CEOs are not typically as visible as athletes, actors and musicians so when you hear of a CEO making 7 figures, there isn't really a frame of reference. Many CEOs are actually worthy of the money they make. The same cannot always be said of actors, athletes and musicians. Also, the vast majority of CEOs do not make entertainer salaries."}
{"src": "Why are so many people up in arms over \"you have to have health insurance\" initiatives, but are okay with mandated car insurance?", "trg": "AFAIK nobody has taken up arms over either. Mandated car insurance is unfortunate as well though, because it means that the insurance companies can now raise their prices, which people will then say have to be regulated by the government, and then we continue down that dark road."}
{"src": "Why are Chinese and Japanese people called \"Asians\", but Indians aren't?", "trg": "When Asian Indian is available on applications and forums, I just put Asian, as that's what us Indians are. Most people fail to call Indians as Asians because we do not look or act similar to what most people refer to as Asians (i.e. Chinese and Japanese)."}
{"src": "Why are Chinese and Japanese people called \"Asians\", but Indians aren't?", "trg": "In the UK we call people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the like \"Asians\" due to them being the most numerous and prominent group of immigrants from Asia. People from China, Japan, Korea, Laos, and places like that are called \"Orientals\". This term does not carry the negative connotations that it does in the US. However, the term \"Asians\" is being used sometimes to refer to people from these places too nowadays."}
{"src": "Why are Chinese and Japanese people called \"Asians\", but Indians aren't?", "trg": "In Japan, it doesn't matter which country; if it's in the continent of Asia, then that country and its people are referred to as Asian. In Australia however, East Asian and South East Asian are referred to as Asian, whereas Indian is referred to as Indian. Also, I've found Middle Eastern is referred to as Arab."}
{"src": "Why are Chinese and Japanese people called \"Asians\", but Indians aren't?", "trg": "Appearance, culture, and language. Why is Australia \"the west\" when it's Far East? Is Russia in Europe or Asia? The borders are pretty arbitrary, and are defined more by cultural identity and skin colour than anything else."}
{"src": "Why are people from northern countries taller and have longer bones if there is less sun exposure (due to shorter days in summer and generally bad weather), which is the main factor responsible for Vitamin D production in our organism, the vitamin that regulates bone growth?", "trg": "If vitamin D had such a direct impact on height, you could take vitamin D supplements (which do work to replace sun-derived Vitamin D for people who don't produce enough themselves) and it would increase your height. It doesn't. A deficiency of vitamin D can prevent proper bone development, but outside of those conditions it doesn't \"control\" height or growth speed."}
{"src": "Why do flies fly in patterns without a destination nor an obvious reason that would make them want to do so?", "trg": "What I want to know is why gnats...who do not actually eat human faces...will unerringly seek out a person and get in their face, no matter how much room is provided. And if you ignore them long enough, they crawl into your nose and tear ducts and die while causing mild revulsion and distress."}
{"src": "Why is ignorance of the law not a valid excuse in court?", "trg": "Yes it is highly subjective and law can be a bitch. It can work with you and against you depending how things are worded and how good your lawyers are. Its a pretentious and bullshit system that fucks over many people. However, that is all we have. If there were no laws, the world would be chaotic. So it's a slippery slope"}
{"src": "How did the trend of Casinos being on Indian preservation's start? Why did they choose Casinos instead of having something else being protected on their land?", "trg": "Gambling laws are set by the state. Indian reservations operate independently of state jurisdiction, so they can set up casinos in states where it is otherwise illegal. They also will frequently sell items like cigarettes that let people avoid high state taxes."}
{"src": "why does the number 142857 behave like it does when multiplied?", "trg": "I had the hardest time finding the significance of the number and had to get to the post where it was talking about the division of 999999 for me to finally get what's going on. Even after then I'm like kinda meh, but that's probably because I already knew about the repeating number division of 9s though."}
{"src": "Why are Whites in America often referred to as \"Caucasians\"? (a word derived from the Caucasus mountain region of Central Asia)", "trg": "Essentially: Originally Caucasian was coined to describe white Europeans, particularly Germans. Later the term was co-opted (now Caucasoid) along with \"Negroid\"; \"Mongoloid\"; and \"Australoid\" to classify common, but distinct, facial features without necessarily referencing skin tone."}
{"src": "Why couldn't Edward Snowden return to America, where he would need to face a proper and fair trial, and appeal his case until it reaches the Supreme Court?", "trg": "I just thought of something. Couldn't the defense argue that Snowden cannot be charged with violating the Espionage Act as he leaked the classified documents to Wikileaks, which is not a hostile government but closer to a corporation? Yeah he leaked classified information, but didn't actually hand it over to Russia so it isn't actually treason."}
{"src": "Why and how is the US allowed to have military bases all over the world?", "trg": "It's not like they just come and say \"We'll build a base here\", they're usually invited by that country. I'm Lithuanian. Our constitution says that foreign militaries can't set up their bases here. What happens instead is that we build our own military bases (using their money) and then invite their soldiers to train together with ours. We get high class, well equipped soldiers and in exchange they get to watch Russia from up close."}
{"src": "Why and how is the US allowed to have military bases all over the world?", "trg": "Some places we asked nicely. Some places asked us nicely. Those places wanted us to help against their enemies. Some places we moved in after we fought, and then stayed. The new government was usually very pro-US after the last one got beat up. Some places we straight up annexed and made part of the US. Some of these places gained their Independence, but are still very pro-US."}
{"src": "Non disclosure agreements", "trg": "Usually the NDA specifies what you are not allowed to disclose. I have one because I may work on/with some technology that isn't public yet. Also, I'm not allowed to give out technical details about what I'm doing. If I breach the NDA my contract may be terminated and I can be forced to pay a certain fee. This does not extend to other stuff that may happen in the office."}
{"src": "What is the emotional 'awwww' feeling we get when we see cute things? Why does it happen?", "trg": "Emotions are like memories from our evolutionary history. They direct our behavior without us learning them first, because they are part our genetic code. We respond to certain queues around youth, like a high eye size to head size ratio with a caring impulse. It helps our species survive by making us more likely to care for our young."}
{"src": "Why do I feel alert and energetic when I accidentally wake up early, but then exhausted, struggling to get up, and constantly hitting the snooze, when I fall back asleep and my alarm goes off an hour later?", "trg": "I work for a company where I don't set an alarm and wake up naturally. I get in between 8-10 and leave 5-7. I feel great pretty much all day, unless I eat a heavy lunch. If more companies let their employees do that, they might have more productive employees."}
{"src": "Why would/wouldn't the Chris Rock approach to Gun Control of taxing bullets work?", "trg": "One reason not to do it is that the average criminal only needs a handful of \"bullets\" to go out and rob a store or kill someone. A typical target shooter will go through a hundred rounds in a range trip. \\#papertargetlivesmatter"}
{"src": "What was the point in www. and why is it still a thing?", "trg": "It's not so important anymore, but in the early days of the internet, www. URL_1  was how you accessed the web page for  URL_1 , as opposed to  URL_0 , where you would access email for  URL_1  -- it was the subdomain for  URL_1  that indicated \"There's a web page here\""}
{"src": "What happens if a parking ticket is lost/destroyed before the owner is aware of the ticket, and it goes unpaid?", "trg": "In my city you also get something by mail to the registered address on the car. Failure to pay increases the fine and eventually it goes to collections. For us, parking citations are a civil violation and there's no possibility of criminal prosecution."}
{"src": "What does it mean if Russia leaves the 1987 nuclear treaty?", "trg": "It means they'll start testing new missiles and nuclear systems. The other parties to the treaty (most importantly the US) will probably start too. If it happens, you'll probably start seeing an increase in military development projects from both sides, along with more sabre rattling. However, it won't go any further than that."}
{"src": "What is the difference in skill between circus performers and gymnasts? Could circus performers be competitive in gymnastics events?", "trg": "There is definitely cross-over, but it's usually the other way around. A lot of people try gymnastics growing up and it's not unusual for circus performers to have that background. Cirque recruits gymnasts reasonably regularly but gives them additional training for the specific thing they want them to do. As a more open / amateur circus group, the people I train with take anyone who wants to have a go but the there's still some former gymnasts there and it definitely gives them an advantage"}
{"src": "why aren't we all thanking President Obama for lower gas prices when we all blamed Bush for higher prices?", "trg": "Because those who control the messaging for \"we all\" have a political interest in blindness to his achievements. In fact, in a broader context, future historians will ask your excellent question in wonderment."}
{"src": "Why is frying a frozen turkey dangerous?", "trg": " > I get that water is more dense than hot oil, so it will sink, evaporate, and **cause a grease fire.** Emphasis added  > BUT why....why is frying a frozen turkey more dangerous than frying a thawed one? ??"}
{"src": "When the barometric pressure changes, why do surgically repaired areas get sore?", "trg": "I don't have a solid answer for this of course, but I can let you know that apparently my mother's shoulder can tell when a big storm is coming. She'll put it out on Facebook as well warning everyone. Oddly enough she's usually right, an ice storm, thunderstorm, something ends up happening within the next couple days. She still sounds like a nutter doing it, but it's interesting it's usually right. :)"}
{"src": "When the barometric pressure changes, why do surgically repaired areas get sore?", "trg": "My brother was in a car accident a long time ago and had to have a small metal plate put in his head. Before a storm would come in, even if it didn't look like it, he would call it. And it was pretty accurate. Not quite science, but damnit I'm not Bill Nye."}
{"src": "Why do women change salutation to Mrs. (from Ms.) while men stays Mr. regardless of civil status?", "trg": "Before gender equality was considered a good thing, women had few opportunities to support themselves, and an unmarried woman was considered a burden on her family. So her future livelihood depended upon finding a husband. In addition, men pursued women, not the other way around. This made it more important for women to advertise their marital status than it was for men."}
{"src": "How do registered sex offenders go to grocery stores and malls etc, where children just are naturally?", "trg": "From a relative that was put on lifetime probation for having sex with a minor. He is not allowed at malls, any movie under a rated r, corner stores, etc. If he is in a place where a minor shows up, he has to leave. For the record, this person and I have no contact because he's a horrible person, so this is just from when he was sentenced."}
{"src": "Why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like Dell, HP, Alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and RAM?", "trg": "Intel has spent a lot of money advertising that PC's with \"Intel inside\" are better than PC's without. Intel is so successful that to the average consumer, the biggest discernable feature in a PC is having it or not. This makes it so that the driving force behind the decission to purchase is the intel processor and not other specs/hardware."}
{"src": "Why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like Dell, HP, Alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and RAM?", "trg": "New CPUs are released less often than video cards. Therefore from a marketing point of view, CPU tech is more stable as a 'latest and greatest' selling point than other components. So it's easier to sell a machine by focusing on that area rather than video. And everyone knows you can just 'add more memory' to a machine to fix problems, duh! :)"}
{"src": "How does the Secret Service avoid hiring someone with the intent of killing the President?", "trg": "I admitted to homosexuality and drug use (pot only) and still got my secret level clearance in the 80s. Once I admitted to those I had to go through a top secret level interview. The personal interview was long. I don't think that they went to the trouble of interviewing friends; I don't remember ... probably because I stayed toasted during the summers. Both of my parents held really high clearances already. Maybe they didn't care if a stoner dyke was shredding paper."}
{"src": "Why is turboprop aircraft obsolete in commercial but not military aviation?", "trg": "There are places jet aircraft just can't get into. Grass landing strips in the middle of the jungle, short runways, crap terrain. Bush pilots in Super Cubs and ancient DC-3's will exist until they can't round up parts anymore. Buffalo Airways up north still runs piston radial DC-3's in cargo and passenger service. There are a bunch of old Convair 440's (or some derivative) that make daily flights to the Caribbean from Florida every day."}
{"src": "Why is it considered harming or disturbing for children to witness sexual content?", "trg": "It probably has something to do with the fact that our country is governed by laws that reflect christian values which generally condemn sex and make it very taboo. I wouldn't be surprised if there are or were cultures that didn't consider it a bad things for kids to be exposed to sexuality and it probably just seemed natural."}
{"src": "Why is it considered harming or disturbing for children to witness sexual content?", "trg": "Because sex and sexuality are extremely complex, and most parents would rather teach their children about it themselves at an age that they believe their child will be able to understand than learn about it through the boobtube."}
{"src": "Why are license plates blurred out on TV when they are in public for anyone to see?", "trg": "They do this because they dont want to leave information in the video that can be traced back to people, who has not given their concent to be in the video. Although you might find it harmless, the persons still didn't give their conscent, and might think that it in some way or another, puts them in a bad light. Then they sue you (ONLY IN 'MURICA) for that, because American law is stupid, and people are greedy as fuck. Simple as that."}
{"src": "Why does moving my hair sometimes hurt my scalp if I haven't showered?", "trg": "I just had this conversation with my hairdresser. Top answer is right, but it also might be the weight of your hair. If you have thick or curly hair, you know it gets really heavy the longer it gets. When you get it cut next time, just ask them to take the weight off, not necessarily the length (if you like it long). I just did, and it helps a lot. Also if you have cowlicks, pulling your hair against them can cause that mild pain as well."}
{"src": "If women receive less than men for the same job, why don't companies just hire women?", "trg": "because for the same job and same company they dont usually get paid less. Women tend to end up in carreers that pay less, they ask for raises less, they dont climb the corporate ladder as quickly etc. Women get paid less than men yes, just not usually for the same jobs."}
{"src": "If women receive less than men for the same job, why don't companies just hire women?", "trg": "Funnily enough, I worked with a women in STEM group that inadvertently ended up promoting this. We had a request for a finance-focused presentation for a company on why they should hire women. It got twisted into \"Hire more women because they're used to getting paid less and won't demand raised.\" Oops."}
{"src": "Why have humans not evolved to enjoy the foods that are best for their health?", "trg": "We have. We have only had stable surplus in food supplies for give or take 200 years, and that is not even true for all of the planet. In nature we live in near starvation like most animals and so evolved to seek out foods that provide the most nutrition for the lease amount of effort. That type of food is fat, sugar, and salt."}
{"src": "In sex scenes in movies do they sometimes just actually have sex?", "trg": "There are rumors they actually had sex in Monster's Ball but it's unconfirmed. They rarely have sex except in rare indie films and Lars Von Trier crap. Most times the male is wearing a cock sock that covers up their naughty bits."}
{"src": "How do bugs in games occur?", "trg": "I wouldn't call them typos. The game or application has many code paths it can take based on user input. And in games there is a lot of user input. There is a Q/A team but they mostly test out the sane code path as a normal user would take. They cannot possibly test out all permutations. There will be odd cases which will uncover untested bits of code or high enough levels where they didn't anticipate anyone getting to."}
{"src": "why do laptop batteries have a shorter life after a while, and how can you best use a laptop battery so it has a longer life?", "trg": "It has to do with the chemical structure of a Lithium battery. The way a lithium battery works is that during operation Lithium ions are removed from a lithium bearing compound from one contact, transferred across an electrolyte, and deposited on the other contact. When recharging, the process is reversed. The degradation comes from the fact that each time the cycle is performed, impurities are introduced into the structure of contacts, reducing their effectiveness."}
{"src": "If banknotes are manufactured daily. How are old banknotes disposed of ? How is an equilibrium maintained ?", "trg": "When you buy stuff with cash, (if not you, other people do) business will end up with a lot of money at the end of each day. They take the cash and deposit it in a bank so they can pay their debts and other business stuff. Banks will remove old or damaged bills and replace them with fresh new bills. No new money has entered the system, it's just traded out."}
{"src": "Why do we even let kids believe in Santa Claus?", "trg": "I'm not at all. I don't even think I will tell my son about Santa. I know people might frown on me about it, but I really don't care. My brother is getting to that age (7) where he needs to told Santa isn't real, but my mom won't do it."}
{"src": "Why are plays considered to be literature, but film scripts are not?", "trg": "Literature means any written work. So, yes it is literature. Feature and TV screenplays are very different from novels, and even plays. The screenplay has its own unique format and structure. Being a great writer of novels doesn't mean you will be a great screenwriter. Structure and pacing is almost always more important to a script than tremendous descriptive ability."}
{"src": "How does pure alcohol have calories, yet it doesn't contain sugar, proteins or fat?", "trg": "Alcohol contains 7 calories per gram (carbs/protein 4, fat 9). Your body is forced to burn off alcohol before anything else, so in essence, alcohol can stop your metabolism from burning off other things like stored body fat."}
{"src": "why do certain countries, such as the United States, seem to always be at war with someone? How have some countries managed to stay relatively peaceful? (Ex. Switzerland)", "trg": "Check your facts. Aside from supporting minor conflicts, the US has been involved in a grand total of about ten significant international wars in 239 years. That's a pretty good track record for peace. Keep hugging your trees while guys like me (a veteran of two of those wars) keep you safe from the countless bastards around the world who want YOU dead just for things as simple as the freedom to question war."}
{"src": "why do certain countries, such as the United States, seem to always be at war with someone? How have some countries managed to stay relatively peaceful? (Ex. Switzerland)", "trg": "It's important to remember that most countries and groups of people were, before WWII, always fighting with some other group. When you look at things in the grand scope what America is doing isn't very unusual at all. It's really because of WWII that America emerged as such a supreme economic force with way too many interests to protect abroad to maintain it's, and the allies, massive economies."}
{"src": "In the United States, why are positions like Attorney General, Secretary of State, etc. appointed by the president at the federal level but elected by the people at the state level? Had it ever been proposed to do this differently?", "trg": "In state government, you can have significant gridlock within the Executive branch if the heads of various agencies come from different parties and have different political agendas (even if they are from the same party). This can be good or bad depending on your perspective, but it's rarely efficient."}
{"src": "When you're swimming, why doesn't the water flood your ears and kill you?", "trg": "Lucky for you, your ear has a protective barrier called your tympanic membrane (eardrum). This keeps the middle and inner ear separated from the outside environment. Even if your eardrum gets torn, your body has a connection from the ear to the throat known as your Eustachian tube so if you were to go swimming with a perforated eardrum (a bad idea since the risk for infection skyrockets), you'd still be alright."}
{"src": "Is nodding for 'yes' and shaking the head for 'no' universal? Or is it a specific to certain cultures?", "trg": "I live in Micronesia and a common way to say \"Yes\" is to raise your eyebrows. No other part of the face changes the eyebrows just go up and down once. Took me awhile to catch on to that one, for a long time I thought my students were blatantly ignoring me when I asked them a question. Shaking head and nodding is also understood, but the eyebrows are used more often than nodding, I'd say."}
{"src": "In English, why is \"I\" capitalized, but not \"me\"?", "trg": "I'd speculate it could be from the advent of the printing press. Vowels if you see a press are all over the damn place. It would have saved them a lower case i to consistently use the capital I and free up a lower case i based on how often you would see I in a sentence."}
{"src": "In English, why is \"I\" capitalized, but not \"me\"?", "trg": "I'm surprised noone has said this.. I asked this question to one of my English teachers in high school. According to him.. I is more formal, and takes the place of a name. It is also capitalized to identify that it is a personal pronoun, and refers to the *subject*. Me is not capitalized because it's a more informal pronoun and refers to the *object*. However, it always made more sense to me that it's capitalized because it's a single letter."}
{"src": "What is the purpose of teaching children to believe in Santa Claus? Is it for reasons other than to teach good behavior?", "trg": "\"christmas is the season of giving\" When a child gets a huge pile of presents and only has some arts and crafts for mom and dad it can create a guilty feeling in some children. Santa allows parents to spoil their kids without taking responsibility for the gifts...which alleviates some of the inequality of giving"}
{"src": "Why can't or don't they bring those dead bodies down from Mt. Everest?", "trg": "Simply getting up and down the mountain is a difficult task, and carries a lot of risk. Going up the mountain with enough resources and manpower to bring somebody down is generally considered too risky."}
{"src": "When glancing at a clock, why does the first second after glancing at it sometimes feel longer than the rest?", "trg": "When you looked at a clock for the first time, there will be \u201cframes\u201d missing for a very short amount of time, instead of making those missing frames black, your brain fills the missing frame by making the second \u201clonger\u201d than it should be"}
{"src": "How poverty can lead to obesity?", "trg": "One thing all these posts are missing is *time* and how poor people have less. There's the multiple jobs thing which chews hours, but also commuting. Ten minute by car can easily be 45 by bus. Both ways. To each job. Add that up, and not only do you not have time to cook, you don't have time to exercise either Forget affording it, poor people don't have time for the gym"}
{"src": "Why are phone scammer that spoof caller ID unstoppable? Why can't telecom operators filter spoofed caller ID info the way data networks filter spoofed IP addresses?", "trg": "The phone system has intentional vulnerables built into it, simply because it's based upon trusted phone companies supplying valid information, then there is the huge use case of call centers. These want to show customers the name and dial back number of whatever company they are contacted to at the time. Allowing this caller number and ID to be a simple header of the call request was just such a good option that there is at this point no way to convert to a locked down ecosystem"}
{"src": "How does a bladeless fan work?", "trg": "The bladeless fan that you are referring to has a fan inside of it. [The \"bladeless\" advertisement is about the delivery of air that you feel, which is slightly different than a conventional fan.]( URL_1 ) But a fan is just one application of a [pump]( URL_0 ), i.e. a device that moves fluid. Most pumps have some moving parts to create the flow, e.g. propellers. But others move fluid by compression of volume, such as your heart, lungs, or speakers. So technically you're a bladeless fan."}
{"src": "How does a bladeless fan work?", "trg": "If u have a long bag like a newspaper bag, or sub sandwich bag, if u try to fill it like a balloon it will take a couple puffs. But if you hold the opening wide and blow into it from a short distance it will fill instantly. The pressure going in pulls the air from outside the bag with it. That's how the extra air is pulled like these rings."}
{"src": "Why are erasers made of rubber, and what makes them able to erase graphite?", "trg": "In extremely simple terms, graphite has a stronger bond to rubber erasers than it does to most types of paper. Erasers are made of rubber because it reaches into the texture of the paper better than other materials."}
{"src": "why are kitchen sinks mostly made of stainless steel, but bathroom sinks made or ceramic, porcelain or enamel-coated materials and white?", "trg": "In addition to what others are saying about toughness and impact resistance, another important aspect is that it is resilient and has a bit of bounce. If you've ever washed plates and glasses in a rigid sink like concrete or porcelain, you'll find you end up breaking them way more often. A stainless sink will allow you to bump and occasionally drop fragile items without them breaking."}
{"src": "Why did Florida get such a bad reputation for trashiness?", "trg": "Because the State of Florida has EXTREMELY extensive government transparency (\"Sunshine\") laws, where reporters have access to large quantities of governmental, police (arrest information, court proceedings, etc), and such information. So it's pretty much just a matter of fishing for the strangest stories. Also, American Media, the publisher of most of the tabloids in America, is based in Florida, which means a lot of \"local color\" stories ends up getting published as national news."}
{"src": "Why do Swedish people speak English so well?", "trg": "It's not just Sweden. Most of the well-educated people in western countries are taught English from a young age, often starting around age 7-10, in school as an official required subject. With English being a dominant language in the world, it only makes sense to make it required study for anyone who wants to work in the modern world."}
{"src": "Why are some redditors so apathetic toward rape victims?", "trg": "I think that a lot of it is because the definition of 'rape' has expanded a lot recently, and that some internet feminists want it applied to acts as ludicrously not-rape as farting loudly. Rape is a serious crime, and a serious thing for a person. It can shatter them emotionally. But because the word has been co-opted by a political campaign, it's unfortunately become very hard to discuss."}
{"src": "Do different GPS companies have different satellites that their customers beam to?", "trg": "I wrote software for a GPS application once on on board terminals. They all use the same sats. They all work similar. You have a GPS-antenna which receives a shitload of data continuosly in a specific format. It's up to you to do whatever you want with that data and that's where they differ."}
{"src": "The Watergate scandal and exactly what Nixon did that would have had him impeached had he not resigned?", "trg": "LBJ has had his own tapes recently declassified, and it appears he had the goods on Nixon for treason for dealing with the Viet Cong privately. It would explain why he risked so much for that break in, and why he worked so hard to cover it up."}
{"src": "Why are adults woken up automatically when they need to pee, while young children pee the bed?", "trg": "Adults who pee the bed, particularly after drinking, are also the same people who typically have issues premature ejaculating. I've read it's the same muscle/nerve/whatever that controls both mechanisms. Someone less drunk than me please feel free to reinforce or debunk."}
{"src": "How did wild humans deal with the pain of walking barefoot?", "trg": "Most islanders or third world people walk everywhere barefoot. When I was growing up in Guam and the Mariana islands, my friends and family never wore anything on our feet. We'd go to the beach, store, school, everywhere barefoot. To someone who never does it the asphalt/sand will be extremely hot and little thing will hurt, but as time goes on you get used to it."}
{"src": "How do cellphones communicate over such long distances with such a small antenna while my router barely can cover my house?", "trg": "The simple answer is that cellphone towers are transmitting with a lot more power than your WiFi router. It has nothing to do with the frequencies, as WiFi and cellphone towers have similar frequencies."}
{"src": "Why am I compelled to buy health insurance but doctors are not compelled to accept it?", "trg": "So i see a lot of people arguing in the comments on whether it should be free/paid for/less of a retarded system. You're right. It's ridiculous we can't pay a reasonable amount. Either directly or through taxes so it's \"free\" but if you don't like it go vote.

{"src": "If nobody \"owns\" the internet, who exactly am I giving money to when I buy a domain?", "trg": "The internet and Domain name are 2 different things. Some one just came up with the idea to associate a domain name to a network address like 192.872.736.22 so you don't have to remember a long number to find a website. You're paying for a company to store that name eg.  URL_0  so when someone types in  URL_0  it will forward to wherever your site is stored. You can forward it to your home computer if u want."}
{"src": "If nobody \"owns\" the internet, who exactly am I giving money to when I buy a domain?", "trg": "You paid the registrar when you bought the domain, so that's a silly question because you know exactly who you paid. The person you paid. Someone needs to hold the records of who owns the domain so you can be contacted."}

{"src": "If Muslims commit murder like we saw in France, why is the media so quick to label it terrorism? If a Christian did it while screaming \"Praise be to Jesus\", would that also be labeled terrorism or would we just call him crazy? Is this biased Journalism?", "trg": "This is a very interesting question. I would argue that the bombings of abortion clinics by Christian groups fall under Terrorism since it is defined as the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. So, if the killing of someone or group of people is to affect political change (in this case, the use of holy \u2014 christian or muslim \u2014 imagery in a manner they disagree with), then yes, it would fall under the basic premise of terrorism."}
{"src": "Why is it that in the past, society could afford really elaborate, ornate public buildings or big civic projects, but now there seems to be no money for anything but the most functional buildings, and we can barely pay for road maintenance?", "trg": "If you go way back in time, Roman era for instance, it was spoils of war that made huge projects like the Colosseum or the Pantheon possible. Gold from sacked cities, free manpower in the form of enslaved persons. An emperor returns from war and wins the people with monuments and games in his honor. In modern times, safety and efficient economical design usually govern a construction project."}
{"src": "Why is it that in the past, society could afford really elaborate, ornate public buildings or big civic projects, but now there seems to be no money for anything but the most functional buildings, and we can barely pay for road maintenance?", "trg": "There are very few people who do detailed, ornate work like we used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is not the current style, so no one builds that way right now. Politicians cannot put their name on a filled pothole, so they do not care if they are fixed."}
{"src": "Why does it seem that the more religious a society is, the more anti-sex it is?", "trg": "Not so much anti-sex as anti sex that isn't for having babies by two members of the same religion. A baby born to two parents from a religion is a new member automatically. It's all about filling pews. It's best to get them young."}
{"src": "Is it possible to attach a cable to the moon that is also attached to the earth or hangs in our atmosphere that can then be used for energy or as a means of transport to the moon and back?", "trg": "Theoretically you could have a wire span far out into space but attaching it to the moon is impossible. The spin of the earth would keep it tight though and the end would spin much faster than the beginning. It could be used to launch spacecraft. Material doesn't exist yet to do this, although there are promising leads."}
{"src": "why do car companies make insanely cool concept cars and then when the cars are released to market, they look like regular old cars?", "trg": "Price. With a concept car its art, with the product its business. The company has a box of parts, and adding anything new is expensive.

{"src": "How can scientists say that if Global temperatures rise even 1\u00b0, disasters will happen, even though temperatures can differ more then 1\u00b0 from day to day?", "trg": "Like you\u2019re five: sometime days you have an extra cookie at lunch. Some days you don\u2019t. But if you had two cookies every day, you\u2019d eventually get fat. And once you\u2019re fat, you might not feel like playing outside so much, so you\u2019ll get even fatter. The Earth\u2019s temperature is similar. 1\u00b0 high one day no problem, but that same 1\u00b0 over a long time period can melt glaciers, destroy forests, and bring about more powerful hurricanes. Some of these changes make the temperature swing even more."}
{"src": "How does \u201cactivated charcoal\u201d work and why has it become so wildly popular in beauty/cosmetic products?", "trg": "The charcoal serves to absorb toxins and stains but will not actually whiten your teeth. Teeth color comes from the color of \u201cdentin\u201d which is a layer underneath the surface of your teeth. Things like whitestrips will bleach/stain the dentin white. Almost everyone has naturally off-white/yellow natural teeth. Active charcoal will just get your teeth as \u201cwhite\u201d as your teeth naturally are, but won\u2019t give you that Hollywood smile."}
{"src": "How do people make/steal money using credit card skimmers?", "trg": "The quickest and easiest way people make money from using skimmers is by selling the collected information to other people. They'll collect a list of names, card numbers, and PINs, then sell it to someone else who has the ability to use it for a few hundred dollars. That person can then clone the cards or use the info online, make a bunch of purchases, then sell the bought items for cash."}
{"src": "Why do we tend to view mammals and furry/soft animals, even predators, with a positive physical connotation (cute, pretty, regal, etc) but scaly animals, insects, arachnids etc are viewed with a negative physical connotation (gross, ugly, fearful)?", "trg": "This video from vsauce is relevant:  URL_0  Basically, there are some who theorize that the reason dragons/serpents are prevalent as villians or monsters in many otherwise different cultures around the world is because humans may have a hardwired biological fear of snakes and other predatory reptiles which could date back to the common ancestor of mammals millions of years ago. Doesn't answer the whole question, but I thought you might find it interesting."}
{"src": "Why do directors get so much credit/disapproval if a film or T.V. show is bad/good, shouldn't it fall on the writers who have control of the show/movie?", "trg": "Do you judge the chef or the farmer for how your meal turned out? Sometimes it's the ingredients that make or break a dish but it's the chef's job to take what they got and transform it into something tasty."}
{"src": "How can mobile racing games have real cars/brands while GTA V can't?", "trg": "Another reason I always thought this to be the case is also visual damage. I doubt car makers like to show damage in unrealistic ways on their cars, and it would be a lot of work to make it proper. Maybe that's why racing games often times don't show damage"}
{"src": "If illegal immigrants in the United States have constitutional rights, can they also bear arms?", "trg": "There are numerous laws which prohibit the possession of a firearm while in the commission of a crime. Illegal aliens by their very act of being here are committing an ongoing crime every second they're in the US without permission, hence being in the United States illegally and possessing a firearm is illegal."}
{"src": "How did people with celiacs disease survive in the 18th and 19th century? I feel like there weren't that many \"gluten free\" options..", "trg": " >  I feel like there weren't that many \"gluten free\" options.. You might be surprised. Grains were often grown as cash crops controlled by a landlord, while the peasants subsisted on perishable vegetables that could only be eaten locally. That was the whole basis for the Great Potato Famine in Ireland."}
{"src": "The \"crack epidemic\" of the 80s/90s and the alleged CIA or US government involvement.", "trg": "The bizarre thing is listening to people sneer \"conspiracy theorist\" towards anyone discussing the activities of an agency that is expressly charged with conducting black ops. As if the CIA should be expected to be baking apple pies instead of spying, overthrowing governments, and in the case of Air America running cocaine to fund itself."}
{"src": "The \"crack epidemic\" of the 80s/90s and the alleged CIA or US government involvement.", "trg": "The most important thing to take away is that this is not an isolated incident. I think many Americans would be surprised how much of a common practice it is for these agencies. They even have internal wars over the resources. It's fucked up."}
{"src": "why are train tracks filled with stones?", "trg": "Those stones (called track ballast) serve four primary purposes: - Load-bearing (it distributes and bears the weight of the railroad ties) - Facilitation of water drainage away from the ties - Keeps out vegetation that could interfere with the structure of the track - Helps keep the ties in place"}
{"src": "why are train tracks filled with stones?", "trg": "I didn't see it mentioned here, but apologies if I missed it. The rocks are also erosion resistant. The wear on the over time is very small since the only thing that can cause it is rain, and the water doesn't even have a constant flow. If dirt or sand were used, then you would see some of it washing away after the first small rainfall. You see this is also in effect in the drainage pipe mouths, they use rocks since they don't wash away easily."}
{"src": "why won't any country grant Snowden asylum?", "trg": "Assange went to Ecuadorian territory (an embassy is their territory, ~~technically~~ basically), so he followed their rules on granting Diplomatic Asylum. For Snowden he's probably be granted the same if he went to Ecuador's embassy, but he'd have to go into Moscow for that, which wouldn't happen. Regarding \"what is the **real** reason\" the best we can tell you is what those countries say, everything else is just useless speculation."}
{"src": "Why did Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac hate each other", "trg": "They actually started out as great friends. Tupac was already big in the scene and Big was an up and comer learning a few things from Pac. Big invited Pac to a recording session while Pac was in NYC. Pac ended up getting jumped in the lobby and blamed Biggie for it. After that it just escalated."}
{"src": "Do people with Alzheimers know they don't remember anything, or do they just not question it?", "trg": "They don't realise that they are forgetting things. If you keep pointing it out, they become very upset, stressed, and confused about everything. You have to just repeat yourself when they say they can't remember, without pointing out the condition."}
{"src": "Are bugs capable of conceptualizing their dead brethren as a warning of danger? Are most animals capable of this?", "trg": "I can offer some anecdotal evidence as a hunter. I've seen white tail deer, Canadian geese, and ducks of many types come right up to a recently killed animal of the same species and go about their day as normal. Death is commonplace in the wilderness."}
{"src": "Why is almost every country in debt?", "trg": "Countries go into debt by investing in themselves. Building infrastructure, building the economy, building militaries, supporting the citizens that cannot support themselves, supplying benefits such as education/healthcare/police/fire/etc to citizens. A country that is not at least slightly in debt is not investing in itself, or is not doing so quickly which means it is dying."}
{"src": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "trg": "Doing a lot of small task is usually easier than doing one big task. For example nobody has any problem reading reddit all day, but reading a full book is hard and daunting. Every time you finish doing something, you get some kind of satisfaction, and we like to get that often."}
{"src": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "trg": "Because with 3 episodes of TV you likely go through three 3-act structures of setups, problems and resolutions - usually with some sort of cliffhanger at the end, with less time having to be spent on exposition as its not a standalone movie, which probably makes the pacing much better/faster giving such an effect."}
{"src": "Why do humans have fetishes?", "trg": "We don't know. At least we don't know well enough to do anything about them. Lots of people have all kinds of speculation, and things they feel like should be true or makes sense to them, but there is no strong consensus explanation."}
{"src": "Why do humans have fetishes?", "trg": "This is my own theory, based on people I know. In the modern age, especially developed countries with readily available internet, people are exposed to a lot of porn and other sexual content on a daily basis. This has pretty much made vanilla sex ordinary, or boring. So people try to add something 'new' or 'extreme' to try and make it more interesting."}
{"src": "Why are dangerous items like laptop batteries allowed on planes, but not toothpaste or water?", "trg": "Laptop batteries can burp fire, but they're not really that dangerous. Nitrogen based explosives are easy to detect, but non-nitrogen based explosives like TATP can look like a bottle of water. A plane interior can take an explosion 100ml or less of TATP. This happened recently in Africa I believe. A guy detonated a small explosive, putting a small hole in the fuselage. Which he got sucked out of, everyone else was fine."}
{"src": "Why does Apple keep changing their ports?", "trg": "There is a reason: whenever there's a change, there's almost always a significant improvement. Lightning port is much, much faster than the old 30-pin connector (which dates back to 2000, by the way). USB3.1 is better than even that, and it's not Apple's invention, it's an international standard, announced last year, and it'll soon be on everything. It's a replacement for the USB2.0 ports that you use for everything now, with much better speeds, and able to carry enough power to charge a laptop."}

{"src": "Why do we sleep on bed frames, and not just a mattress on the floor?", "trg": "Probably bed bugs. They are disgusting evil creatures. And were once ubiquitous. One trick to prevent is put the legs of a bed in buckets with water or oil in them. So a big advantage having legs on your bed."}
{"src": "The different subgroups of Catholicism (Jesuit, Franciscan etc)", "trg": "They all believe more or less the same thing and have no impact on the laypeople at all. It's more like different clubs for the clergy. If you're gonna be a monk, that's great more power to you. But you know what's better than being a self proclaimed monk? Being part of an official monk club! And you have so many options. Benedictine, Franciscan, all sorts. Some like to sing. Some don't. They all like to read."}
{"src": "Why are salespeople so adamant about getting you to sign up for their store's rewards card?", "trg": "The salespeople make a big deal out of it because it's a crucial part of how they get promoted, if they aren't getting paid commission. At many stores the rest of what you do isn't even that big of a deal, it's credit cards and rewards cards that let you climb the ladder. For credit cards, the store is paid by the bank that issues the card, and rewards cards are a cheap way to get personal information and purchasing data for targeted advertising."}
{"src": "Why are galaxies relatively flat as opposed to being spherical?", "trg": "Additional question: Our solar system is usually represented in the popular media as flat, i.e. all planets (excluding Pluto) orbiting in the same plane. The exception is Pluto, which orbits in an angle (and having more of an elliptical than a near-circular orbit). Is that truthful? And if so, is that because of the same reason (i.e. like a pizza)?"}
{"src": "Why are galaxies relatively flat as opposed to being spherical?", "trg": "They're flat because they're spinning. They're spinning because random perturbations/collisions can cause things to move but, they almost *never* cause things to stop moving. Once things are moving, they tend to stay moving and, as the object gains mass, it's going to spin faster."}
{"src": "What's the noise we hear in our head when we stretch?", "trg": "I've been able to contract the muscle all my life and noticed it to be a sound dampener. I've always wondered if it really was a set of natural ear protection but now I know. Comes in handy when you work at a gun range."}
{"src": "Why are people against mandatory background checks before buying a gun?", "trg": "They are mandatory when buying from a retailer. Private sales in some states require background checks on private sales as well The big argument is that it will lead to a national gun registry, making future gun bans a possibility. They'll know who has what, and how many. The problem with increased regulations, is that they never know when to stop."}
{"src": "Why can't surgeons simply cut out the fat and excess skin or perform extreme liposuction to people that weigh 500+lbs?", "trg": "Even if it were physically possible to remove the fat via surgery that wouldn't be necessary if the person is going to follow up with bypass surgery and an improved diet. Morbidly obese people who have a successful surgery and stick to the diet lose weight very quickly. Putting them through both gastric bypass and fat trimming surgery at the same time could make their recovery more difficult rather than speed things along."}
{"src": "Why can't surgeons simply cut out the fat and excess skin or perform extreme liposuction to people that weigh 500+lbs?", "trg": "TL;DR: core fat and lasting effects. The reason is lifestyle and core fat. Sure, you could cut off the fat BUT you couldn't do that to the fat in the heart and liver etc.. ONLY exercise can get rid of that hence the lifestyle change. If you cut off that fat then fatties like me would just get op after op. The lifestyle change KEEPS the fat off and rids it from the core. Meaning overall health is achieved rather than aesthetic happiness."}
{"src": "Why can't surgeons simply cut out the fat and excess skin or perform extreme liposuction to people that weigh 500+lbs?", "trg": "You have to lose a certain amount of weight first so you have less of a risk of stroke or heart attack. The fat would also grow back without any modification to the digestive system/eating habits, necessitating dangerous repeat surgeries. I'm sure there are more reasons - I'm just thinking of what I've seen on My 600 Lb Life."}

What did he learn about counting and fundamentals that I take for granted?", "trg": "As is so typical in math, [counting can indeed be generalized.]( URL_0 ) Roughly, counting means establishing a clear one-to-one relationship between the members of one set and the members of another set. Since sets are an extremely elaborate and well-developed topic in abstract math, there is a lot of meat here."}
{"src": "Why do governments and companies keep building luxury apartment skyscrapers in cities where the majority of the population can't even afford the rent?", "trg": "Land is of high value and there are more than enough citizens that can afford that rent so that is the building that is made. Because there are still people able and willing to pay that price supply and demand actually dictates a price increase."}
{"src": "How are consumable meats cultured in labs?", "trg": "About a year ago I listened to a podcast by Sam Harris and he was talking to the CEO of a company called Memphis Meats, who are trying to find a way to mass produced cultured meats.

That was all I really had to go on though."}
{"src": "How are people expected to know the difference between a lawful open carrier and an active shooter who hasn't started shooting yet?", "trg": "This is exactly why I would much rather have concealed carry laws.

Total worldwide installation of new solar was 40 GWhr. U.S. electricity production in 2014 was 4000 GWhr of which 13% was renewable (plus another 19% nuclear). So to get to 50% renewable, the U.S. would need an additional 1500 GWhr of renewable installations or 15 years of the entire world wide production rate."}
{"src": "How did grapes become the most popular fruit to ferment into wine? Why didn't we end up with like a blueberry or apple or banana fermented beverage as a cultural standard?", "trg": "Archeological evidence shows us that early man realized that grapes left in the hot sun for prolonged periods of time produced an alcoholic drink when crushed. Grapes, probably, because they produce large amounts of juice and were naturally occurring and prevalent in Mediterranean regions. This are is where early man lived and would have been hot enough for the juice to ferment."}

The genetic difference between a short white guy and a tall black guy are extremely tiny compared to the genetic difference between 2 different species of bears. The definition of species is obviously not based on what looks physically similar to an untrained human eye, especially since the human brain is wired to notice small differences between humans."}

Later on, this general umbrella term was used for the corn plant in North America (Maize). Corned beef is coated in rock salt (called corn back-then). So there is no actually \"corn\" on corned beef.

{"src": "Why are emotions so amplified right before bed?", "trg": "Total guess. Could be wrong: Nighttime is when you have a chance to reflect on your day, your decisions, etc. The typical distractions are all gone and so you have a chance to think more thoroughly about what you have experienced. There is also an evolutionary fear of the dark that exists in people and when people are afraid, their other emotions are naturally amplified as well."}

{"src": "Why do wounds itch when healing, prompting us to scratch and potentially re-damage the area?", "trg": "when the skin is healing around a wound scabs and hard skin come into play to basically stint the cut: hold the skin still as its slowly drawn together. healthy skin around this stationary area continues to move normally, which pulls gently around the wound setting off mild touch/pain sensations (feels like an itch) its actually the skin around the wound thats itching so scratch the skin on both sides instead of right on the cut and you'll feel much better"}

{"src": "Why dont mass produced foods have as much vitamins/minerals/heathly stuff injected into them as possible for a healthier population.", "trg": "Vitamins are required for health, but that doesn't imply that 'more vitamins equals a better outcome'. If you packed as much as possible into all processed foods, what you'd end up with is people suffering from toxic doses. In the case of some of these (like vitamin A), that is extremely serious, or even fatal."}
{"src": "Why does going to bed later than usual but sleeping the same amount of hours as you normally would, feel worse when you wake up?", "trg": "I have a night shift and college class , I sleep when I can, usually early morning to mid-day or any time. The only difference is how you adjust your sleep cycle and it makes you more keen on getting up and awake instantly, because you're probably already late for class."}
{"src": "Why are there such drastic differences in salaries between different countries?", "trg": "I'm going to avoid discussing service industries, because they are drastically different and less subject to the global market (You can't work construction in Detroit and Munich on the same day) I'm mostly talking tech. The biggest driver of disparity in tech jobs is cost of living. If it costs 2000 a month to live in Boston, and 200 a month to live in India, then salaries will reflect that. Companies aren't in the business of lowering profits to give employees extra spending money."}
{"src": "Because alcohol dehydrates, water hydrates you, and beer is primarily water, is there an alcohol-by-volume threshold in which beers below this threshold hydrate the body and those above it dehydrate the body?", "trg": "Mathematically, yes. This is because of the intermediate value theorem. If you go from positive hydration to negative hydration, you must get to a point of no hydration in-between (assuming continuity or you can have nearly infinitely small increases in alcohol)"}
{"src": "Why do so many European countries show hatred towards the European Union (like the UK), even though it has lead to the most peaceful and stable period in European history?", "trg": "As a Brit, it's primarily because they misunderstood what it is. The tabloids print a lot of propaganda such as them preventing us using our own laws, costing the country a lot of money and forcing immigrants upon us. The truth is that during the referendum not much made it into the tabloids about how much good it does. 48% of Brits didn't want to leave it and the vote was over 18s only. If 16+ had been allowed to vote it is massively unlikely the U.K. Would be leaving."}
{"src": "Why isn't there any passion from both Democrats and Republicans about making voting day a national holiday?", "trg": "Because the idea of a 'one day' to vote is absurd and out dated. A better solution is to create a variety of voting channels (mail in, walk in, etc) and allow people to vote over a longer period of time. That way, people of all situations can find the time to participate."}
{"src": "Why isn't there any passion from both Democrats and Republicans about making voting day a national holiday?", "trg": "A national holiday doesn't mean a whole lot. Fast food places are still open. Factories still run. The grocery store still needs to be stocked. All it means is a couple select groups like federal workers, teachers, and bank employees don't have to work. The other 98% of the worker class still have to clock in."}

My assumption is that most Democrats would as they tend to benefit from higher turnout, historically speaking.

{"src": "How Felix Baumgartner broke the sound barrier if humans have a terminal velocity of around 175 MPH?", "trg": "Terminal velocity is 120mph, he went faster because up near the edge of space the air is so thin you're practically in a vacuum hence no air resistance, so infinite acceleration (getting faster and faster) until he hit higher density air, which is why he slowed down after speeding up."}
{"src": "Why a dog's leg twitches when you scratch the sweet spot.", "trg": "It is because you are scratching near a shallow (as in, closer to the skin) nerve area called a saddle region (usually your dog's back and sides of his legs and tummy) and his nerves think it's an itch and there is an involuntary twitch response for him to scratch it."}

{"src": "Why do Humans only feel butterfly sensation in their stomach when there's a sudden loss of Altitude, and not when there is a sudden gain in altitude?", "trg": "Our guts hang, like if you picked up your shoe by the laces. If you're holding a shoe by the laces, and then move your arm down quickly, the lace bends a little, because your hand moves faster than the shoe. When our body moves downward quickly, the 'laces' of your guts bend a little, like the shoelace. We say this feels like butterflies. If you take the same example, and pull upward on the laces, they stay taught the whole time. No bending = no butterflies."}

{"src": "The controversy with Nestle water", "trg": "I can't speak for other locals but here in Michigan many are opposed to Nestle' because they are getting their water from aquifers that feed many of the cold water trout streams in Northern Michigan.

{"src": "those bidding sites where people pay pennies for stuff", "trg": "Each bid increases the price slightly (say 1p), but you pay for each bid (say 50p), after each bid a timer resets and counts down (say 1 min) if no one else bids before the timer runs out you will win. If you take an item that has a retail price of \u00a31000 the site will require 2000 bids to make its money but the final bid will only be \u00a320. What you have to ask is what is stopping the site injecting fake bids if the timmer runs out before they have made their money!"}
{"src": "those bidding sites where people pay pennies for stuff", "trg": "I don't remember which one, but there is one site that started just below retail price, and each bid lowered the price and extended the timer.

{"src": "Why does absolutely nobody live in Vermont if nearly all other northeastern states like New York and Connecticut are so densely populated?", "trg": "Much of upstate New York is sparsely populated. The Catskills and the Adirondack parks are very sparsely populated. The Adirondack Park in NY has almost the same area as the state of Massachussetts (9375 sq mi vs 10,500 sq mi) and the full-time (non vacationer) population is about a hundred thousand people. Hamilton county NY (in the park) has one traffic light in the entire county, and it's a blinker."}

{"src": "Why do babies/toddlers scream and cry for a long time when they are tired instead of just going the eff to sleep?", "trg": "Sorry, but you are WAY over thinking this. Babies are uncomplicated, and there are a very limited set of reasons for their crying. 1. Hungry 2. Scared 3. Uncomfortable (too hot, cold, stomach pains, filled diaper, diaper rash, etc., and the like). 4. Over tired It really actually is that simple. Then, later on (after you finally figure them out) they will change the rules on you and start teething."}

That thought process won\u2019t solidify sometimes until they\u2019re like 10. So when children feel ill or are tired, they tend to act out.

{"src": "How does panic serve a function? It seems counter-productive to turn off logical function...", "trg": "Panic is when you stop thinking and act on instinct...and you can react much faster on instinct and muscle memory than stopping and thinking about the situation. Basically, a predator jumps out at you, you panic and run away. The simple truth is it doesn't matter *what* you're running away from, just that you're running away as fast as possible. It's a fight or flight reaction: You either leg it or lash out."}

Wouldn't the water soaking their feathers weigh them down?", "trg": "Those type of birds have oil coating that make those particular birds feathers water proof, also as a interesting bit, during oil spills the crude oil sticks to them because like oils like to stick to other oil like things. Reason why cleaning birds is important, the natural oils return after a while but till then the birds need to be cared for or else they would drown if released immediately back into the wild after a soapy wash."}
{"src": "If sperm donation is anonymous, how do they make sure some guy is not sleeping with his daughter 18 years later by a true mistake?", "trg": "I'm a little bit confused. Are you asking if a guy donates sperm anonymously how can he be sure he does not accidentally sleep with his daughter 18 years later? Well the answer is he can't unless he forces every girl he sleeps with to take a DNA test. But the chances of that happening are extremely low."}
{"src": "Is Orange Juice really as unhealthy as soft drinks?", "trg": "When you drink orange juice, you consume much more of it than when you would eat orange fruit. It takes effort and time to peel the fruit, avoid the seeds, and eat only the good parts. Your brain will tell you to stop eating after a few fruits. With juice, you typically gulp down eight oranges in a large glass. Usually, too much of anything isn't good. When it comes to making you drink a lot and consume too much sugar too quickly, orange juice is as unhealthy as soft drinks."}

I mean it's not like they had air conditioning to keep cool and sweat free. Plus no running water for easy showering. Did it just seem normal for you to go into a saloon and everyone smelled awful? Or did everyone (men and women) just douse themselves in cologne or perfume all the time?"}
{"src": "What's the purpose of a blindfold during an execution?", "trg": "There are 3 reasons for this, the first (for electric chairs/shock) is because the eyes would explode or leak and the blindfold was to prevent mess. The second and most common is so that the executioner and the onlookers don't get traumatized by the victim. Lastly the third reason is to both help prevent escape and to make the experience more calm (yes calm, not scary) for the victim."}
{"src": "Why is the U.S. so notorious for using Africans as slaves, when Africans had been using and selling Africans as slaves long before Europeans brought them to the Americas?", "trg": "Black slaves were brought to the US, pretty much because, if they ran away, as white indentured servants had been doing, you could pretty easily tell they were slaves, and be returned. Africans had slaves, but they weren\u2019t slaves just because they were black, they were slaves because they were captured. It\u2019s kind of f\u2019ed up to make someone a slave just because they were different than you."}

{"src": "Sharks, crocodiles etc. When they eat in the water their prey, where does all the water goes when they swallow? Do they somehow filter meat from water or do they just swallow it all?", "trg": "Dunno about sharks but crocs actually have a false palette at the back of their throat to prevent swallowing water when gripping things underwater. They will certainly tear out chunks underwater but they will only consume the meat above water by tilting their heads back to swallow the chunks they tore off. Whatever water is swallowed using *this* method is not a big deal for the crocs."}
{"src": "Sharks, crocodiles etc. When they eat in the water their prey, where does all the water goes when they swallow? Do they somehow filter meat from water or do they just swallow it all?", "trg": "It might help to think of your food sitting in a giant pool of air. How do you eat without consuming vast quantities of air? As you reduce the volume of your mouth by clenching your jaw, you hold the food with your teeth or tongue or even just gravity while your throat is closed. Your mouth stays open and the fluid (air for you and water for sharks etc) leaves via your mouth and then, once most of the fluid is out of your mouth, you open your throat and swallow."}

What's to stop them from making all their campaign promises and their party's agenda into executive orders?", "trg": "Executive orders can only impact very narrow areas. They are, by definition, orders issued by the chief of the executive branch of the federal government, and as such can only impact federal agencies directly under the control of the executive branch, or in areas where authority has been expressly delegated to the executive branch by Congress.

What's to stop them from making all their campaign promises and their party's agenda into executive orders?", "trg": "Lol. Ask the last president. That made up the lions share of his political action. And the check/balance that restricts the president is the Supreme Court ruling an EO unconstitutional.

Also not all items are taxed. I don't know about other states, but in Texas, food in grocery stores is not taxed. So you could go to Wal-Mart and buy milk, bread, and Madden 2016 and only pay tax for the $59.99 of the game and not the amount for the milk and bread.
