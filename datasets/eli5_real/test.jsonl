Even the better actors, sets, production value, etc. help transport you more into the image and allow for that feeling of richness and realness."}
{"src": "Why can I fall asleep in noisy environments (school lectures, public transport, cinemas, etc) but an even lesser amount of noise can disturb my sleep when I'm in bed?", "trg": "So, put simply, your brain chooses to ignore certain stimuli it deems \"unimportant\".

{"src": "Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?", "trg": "Alcohol is volatile and easily vaporizes into the air, allowing you to smell it. Alcohol also is carried in the blood, which easily vaporizes in the lungs, from your blood stream, allowing you to breath it out. Coke is simply digested.

{"src": "Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?", "trg": "Pure ethanol has almost no odor. Your body metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. Volatile aldehydes are potent fragrances. When you smell \"alcohol\" on someone's breath, what you are really smelling is acetaldehyde. [edited] As a PhD in Bacteriology, I have worked with ethanol and many other chemicals for a very long time."}
{"src": "Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?", "trg": "It also has to do with how alcohol is gotten rid of by the body. The liver stores it, then gradually releases it in the blood as it is metabolized, where it is then released into the air by the lungs. This is also how a breathalyzer estimates the amount of alcohol in your blood. The smell is actually acetone."}
{"src": "Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?", "trg": "Non-alcoholic drinks don't really have much smell because the molecules in them are not volatile. The exception is the bubbles of CO2 (which is odorless anyways). Alcohol by itself is a liquid that has significant pressure around body temperature. So if your stomach has alcohol and you burp it will come out smelling of alcohol. If you have alcohol in your blood, it will evaporate from it inside the lungs and come out as the air you breathe out."}
{"src": "Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?", "trg": "the alcohol is in your bloodstream and the smell is coming out via your lungs.

{"src": "Why does alcohol leave such a recognizable smell on your breath when non-alcoholic drinks, like Coke, don't?", "trg": "One of the ways alcohol leaves your body is through your breath. You exhale it through your lungs. While a mixer like cola will leave your body when you pee. This is why you walk into a room where someone has been drinking heavily, there is a heavy alcohol scent.

Which turns trying to work a reasonable amount of hours into a crazy juggling act."}
{"src": "Why do lower-income folk work multiple jobs to support themselves rather than work more hours at a single job?", "trg": "It's typically not by choice but rather due to the lack of full-time jobs available. The problem is a large number of the lower-waged jobs are part-time only since part time workers aren't required to be given benefits and are easier to slot into shift work.

{"src": "Why don't large dogs consider small dogs prey, but they consider cats prey?", "trg": "It really depends on the dog's temperament and socialization. A large dog with a strong prey drive will go after little dogs if not trained not to. I've seen it happen when a relative's big dog went after my small one, grabbing and shaking her. Luckily we were able to separate them quickly and my dog suffered only minor injuries, but the big dog was definitely going for the kill."}
{"src": "Why don't large dogs consider small dogs prey, but they consider cats prey?", "trg": "Smell is a much more important sense for a dog than the eyes. Small dogs probably smell much like big dogs and very different than cats and prey. How an animal moves is another important aspect. Small dogs move like dogs, not like prey. Even a big human can trigger the hunting instinct in a dog if you try to run directly away from the dog. Always show your side to an agressive dog, not your back."}

Outside the city, he is the final word for the Catholic Church's official doctrine.

{"src": "Why is it that as we get older, we are able to handle eating hotter foods", "trg": "I'm not sure I accept the premise. Children in cultures where spicy food is common, think nothing of it. My nephews had no problem eating hot peppers when they were very young because it was just a normal part of their diet. It's a sort of acquired taste/tolerance and it's \"easier\" to acquire that at the very malleable young age. If you don't acquire it when you're very young, then it's a much slower process and might not happen until you're much older."}
{"src": "Why is it that as we get older, we are able to handle eating hotter foods", "trg": "Its not about age, its about how accustomed you are to eating spicy foods. As you eat spicy foods more often you build a sort of tolerance to it, so that you can handle eating slightly spicier foods. When you are a child, you don't have that tolerance because you haven't had a chance to develop it yet."}
{"src": "Why is it that as we get older, we are able to handle eating hotter foods", "trg": "I'm not really sure this is true. In my experience older ladies and gents normally slow down on the spicy stuff a bit. But, if it is, I would argue it's something like how senior citizens go nose deaf. Ever wonder why they have so much cologne/perfume on? It's because they do. Their senses are not as sharp as younger personnel."}
{"src": "Why is it that as we get older, we are able to handle eating hotter foods", "trg": "This probably isn't the only reason, but one likely contributor is that the number of active taste buds a typical person has naturally deteriorates with age, much like our vision and hearing tend to deteriorate with age. So children on average experience tastes more sharply than adults, which is probably one major reason they prefer blander foods."}
{"src": "Why is it that as we get older, we are able to handle eating hotter foods", "trg": "I don't know where you got this from exactly.

And this, my fellow philosophers, is why I believe in free will."}

You can not choose your parents, skin color, and economic class. So it's not really free will but a state of mind.

The basic argument is that the government pretty much sucks at running anything. They can't even handle \"free\" healthcare to veterans- who make up a tiny part of the population. The \"right-wing\" standpoint is that the job of the government isn't to provide for the people. It's to safeguard people's rights to provide for themselves."}

The language part of your brain is able to understand/comprehend foreign languages easier in your youth. This typically fades away as you enter adolencense (9-12). Thats why taking your kid to a bilingual school when hes young is great, learning multiple languages when you're young vastly improves cognitive abilities as an adult."}

It is separate from bias, which many people in this thread seem to be mixing the two. You can be reliable, and biased.

{"src": "What (Who?) Exactly Defines a Reliable News Source?", "trg": "Good news reads like Wikipedia. It links to original sources, shows where their poll data or statistics comes from, and talks about what both sides of an issue are arguing. Almost no news is like that though. Different companies focus on and ignore different stories and view points. Getting the full story takes piecing together information from a wide range of sources."}
{"src": "What (Who?) Exactly Defines a Reliable News Source?", "trg": "Personally I believe a reliable news source tells you the information with as little conjecture as possible. However reliability is based on a person's view of the product as it meets their own set of criterion so it's impossible to definitively call a piece of media reliable or not.

There are exceptions, but the expectation is that even if you are only there to play your sport, you will attend school."}
{"src": "How did American high schools end up being very sports-oriented?", "trg": "Probably based on how much homework they got. I went to elementary school in Russia, where I would usually get home at around 3 or 4 and be doing homework all day, after which I would read a book and go to sleep. That doesn't leave a lot of time for sports, though I did do ballroom dancing twice a week. When I came to Canada though, I basically stopped doing homework after I finished my Grade 7 math textbook in a week, which left a ton of time for gaming and sports."}

I'd probably guess that the only moving parts were the motor that drives the vibration and I suppose the speaker that vibrates for sound. The non-moving parts aren't really effected by being vibrated assuming they are reasonably well constructed. Some electronic devices (like a laptop) do have moving parts and are more likely to sustain problems if moved around or vibrated too much."}
{"src": "Why doesn't a phone with its ringer set as 'vibrate', eventually destroy the mechanisms inside working it?", "trg": "They have found a good middle ground to set the vibrate to. In between too violent that it would degrade the phone vs. too soft that you don't feel the vibration. Also, they design the structure of the phone so that it isn't too prone to damage from vibration, and also use materials that serve the same purpose."}
{"src": "Why doesn't a phone with its ringer set as 'vibrate', eventually destroy the mechanisms inside working it?", "trg": "Vibrations aren't really a problem and cause minimal damage (loosening of screws or small amounts of wear on the interface between components until they match the objects resonance frequency. At that point the material itself begins to experience the energy rather than just transfer it to surrounding objects. You would have to have your phone vibrating all the time to see any issues, and probably then the little electric motor that spins the counterweight would fail first."}

And if it has any momentum at all, it will move towards one of the edges, as there are edges in all directions."}
{"src": "Why do objects floating in liquid are always attracted to the walls of the container?", "trg": "I remember reading a puzzle about this before, it's because surface tension makes the water cling to the edges of the container. This means that the level of the water will be slightly higher near the edges, so the floating object will drift to an edge. On the other hand, if you fill up a cup of water right to the brim so that the water is slightly above the edge of the cup, the water will be highest in the centre and so the floating object will stay in the middle."}

{"src": "Why do towels that feel so rough on the skin dry you so much better, but towels that feel soft don t dry well at all?", "trg": "In most cases, it probably has to do with fabric content. 100% cotton towels are very \"thirsty\" and dry well, but towels that are part polyester (or another synthetic material) and woven with thinner fibers will feel softer to the touch, but not soak up water the way cotton does. The quality and length of the particular cotton, as well as the way it's woven, also factor in."}
{"src": "Why do towels that feel so rough on the skin dry you so much better, but towels that feel soft don t dry well at all?", "trg": "It partly depends on how the towel is made. Terry cloth towels have loops that will wick away moisture on contact. Sheared towels or microfiber type towels are cut and it's harder for the strands to absorb moisture when you rub it on your skin."}
{"src": "Why do babies and toddlers love other babies (including dolls) so much?", "trg": "Nobody's suggested this yet, so here's my opinion: babies and small children have almost no control over their environment or physical being at all. Other more powerful people determine when they eat, where they go, what they do, their physical comfort etc. It's often frustrating for them. So when a child has a doll, pet or even smaller child, it's a chance for them to role-play that powerful person and determine what happens in someone else's life for a change."}

Jack Nicholson was 22 years past his first real movie credit when he told Wendy he wouldn't hurt her if she'd just give him the bat. Those exceptions aside, as someone pointed out, horror films generally depend on either fear or women in skimpy clothing who make stupid decisions, often while babysitting someone else's kids in someone else's home.

{"src": "why is it safe to dry age beef, but unsafe to keep supermarket beef in the fridge for more than a few days?", "trg": "Because bacteria love moist, delicious meat. So if you leave a steak or some hamburger in the fridge for more than a few days, they'll have time to eat and grow all over your food. But bacteria need moisture in them to survive, and dry, salted beef doesn't have much. And even more importantly, the salt will actually pull water *out* of bacteria cells, shriveling them up and killing them. Which is why salting has been one of our best preservation methods for thousands of years."}

{"src": "How is it that water at the bottom of the oceans doesn't freeze, if it's colder at depth? Why is it that water freezes downwards in large bodies of water?", "trg": "When water turns to ice, it needs space for its molecules to arrange themselves in a less dense space. The immense pressure at the bottom of an ocean compresses the water enough to counteract the force of the water expanding. A practical example of pressure melting ice is when you go ice skating. The pressure generated by the skates melts the ice, and hence when ice skating you're actually skating on a very thin film of water."}

If bodies of water froze from the bottom up then plant life would die leaving the food chain without a cog in the wheel.

{"src": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "trg": "Fasting comes in to play- compliance is higher if you over night fast versus making some one fast from 0600. Doctors will block out x amount of time per week for surgeries as they still do consulting etc on other days. Surgery in the morning means patients can often have visitors and spend 'less days' as an inpatient. Morning shifts have lower ratios of patients to nurses here on surgical wards so there are more hands on deck so to speak for the post operative patients."}
{"src": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "trg": "This is because you need to administer a strong anaesthesia for most of these surgeries, for which you need an empty stomach for 10-12 hours. So the patient is made to have an early dinner and then sleep, without making him feel hungry or thirsty during the hours he has to stay without food or water. It would be a major inconvince to skip meals when one is hungry during the day."}
{"src": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "trg": "Surgeons don't just do surgery- they also have office hours where they see patients and supervise the care of other patients in hospital. It is far easier to take care of responsibilities in one location all at one time, then move to the other location for the remainder of the day. As most surgeons (and most patients!) prefer to work when well rested with plenty of energy and mental focus they schedule the most demanding aspects of their job early in the day and have their office hours later."}

One of the other reasons we start early that isn't covered too much in this thread is we want as many people around as possible.

Having extra hands around is always safer."}

{"src": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "trg": "I have seen that there was a study done that showed more of a survival rate of operations that were done in the morning. This is presumably due to the surgeon being in a ready and fully awake state than if they should have to do a four hour op after a full day at work. Also as others have mentioned to do with fasting and the anaesthesia working correctly."}
{"src": "Why are surgeries and operations usually held in early mornings?", "trg": "Nurses and techs have to have you in to get you prepped for the surgery and then watch you recover post surgery.

In a guitar amp the speakers themselves can be an important part of the overall tone of the amplifier, so its important to get that included in the tone you send through the PA system."}
{"src": "Why do bands put a microphone in front of their amp when they're playing concert?", "trg": "A lot of good answers here. Just going to add that this also allows bands to carry around smaller amps. Before venues had PA systems people like hendrix had to travel with 3 full stacks of amps. This was so costly to transport that he had 2 sets one in America one in Europe. Now guitarists can just have one small amp and mic it at the venue."}

{"src": "Why do people's stomach look bloated when they're malnourished?", "trg": "When you're so malnourished your liver can't make a protein called albumin, which is required to keep fluid in your blood vessels. This causes fluid to leave the vessels and enter a cavity like your abdomen. It's the same reason why people with liver cirrhosis get abdominal distension."}
{"src": "Why do people's stomach look bloated when they're malnourished?", "trg": "Protein deficiency. Protein in the blood, primarily albumin, is largely responsible for the osmotic force that keeps water in the pressurized vasculature from leaking out.

{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "Yes it's partly low mass and their exoskeleton, but that isn't the entire reason. It's because of the square - cube law. This principle states that, as a shape (or creature) grows in size, its volume (and weight) grows faster than its surface area. So when the fly hits the wall, there is less weight dispersed over a larger surface area (relatively) than a larger creature.

{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "As others have mentioned, the low mass of insects combined with exoskeleton usually protects them from injury. However, one should also consider that their inherent velocity and acceleration are relatively low (Force= mass x acceleration). If you are driving your car and hit a bug, it does splatter on your windshield as the velocity is much higher. A rapidly flying insect hitting a window may also get hurt."}

You certainly wouldn't need a bicycle helmet anymore. You just can't get enough momentum to need any sort of protection. It's also, I imagine, why land animals don't get much bigger than elephants. With the sheer size of their body it's easier to get hurt. Whales live in a bouyant environment which protects their bodies, so they get to be bigger."}

{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "A lot of people here are giving explanations about surface area and mass. In the spirit of the sub, here's a way to explain it so a five year old might understand. Take about ten ping pong balls, and tape them together. Then throw them at the floor. If you taped them up really well, then they'll stay together. Now, picture a trash bag full of those balls. You can try to hold them together, but there's so many that when they hit, enough will keep moving that whatever is holding them will break."}
{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "F=ma or the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration.

{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "from a physical point of view, it all has to do with Conservation of Momentum and Kinetic energy. both of these are effected by mass and speed. the gist of it is, its not only the high speed that has effects the collision but also the mass of the fly. because the fly is so light weight, the energy it receives when getting hit is still FAR less than what a human would receive going at the same speed. and the fly's body is capable of handling that amount of energy"}
{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "Another of these questions like the one with the concrete wall, it's all in the force that it takes to move a 1 gram fly compared to a 70kg human, it takes muuuuuuuch less force so the fly experiences the same deceleration but it is releasing less energy and has less momentum.

{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "All this explanation of the anatomy of a fly but what it really boils down to is the fly is tiny (little mass) and does not move fast therefore the kinetic energy involved is not enough to cause any significant deformations to *ANYTHING*. In fact most of this kinetic energy will be converted into sound in the form of a soft thud."}
{"src": "How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt?", "trg": "P=M*V That is, momentum is mass times velocity. A fly has very low mass, therefore even at high speeds for a fly it still has low momentum, and hence not a hard collision.

Even if the logic is based in ignorance, it's not like they're taking away anything from true celiac's. In fact, one could argue the growth of the fad has made it all the more easier for celiac's to have greater access to GF foods."}
{"src": "What is the logic behind a gluten free diet", "trg": "The short and sweet answer is that many people are allergic or have and intolerance to gluten. It is not necessarily healthier like most people assume. Also, many confuse gluten with wheat. Wheat is just one grain that contains gluten. Now speaking of wheat, this is really the biggest problem. The wheat we eat these days is ridiculously modified with little resemblance to what out ancestors ate and is causing many health problems, such as autoimmune disorders."}
{"src": "What is the logic behind a gluten free diet", "trg": "For people like me, who have celiac, it's basically so that our small intestines don't rip to shreds. a lot of the health nuts think that going on a gluten free diet is good for anyone, but what they're doing is starving themselves if nutrients they need by avoiding wheat in its entirety. But I do like the health nuts, without them I couldn't get all my gluten free food as easily as I can now than five years ago"}

Anyone with intermediate cooking skills can take the ingredients and make a tolerable piece of sushi.

Doing this all at high speed in volume, without reducing quality, is even harder."}
{"src": "What are sushi masters doing that is so masterful?", "trg": "Sushi chefs also have to master 'nigiri' (along with other skills mentioned before) which involves the incorporation of air into the rice when they are 'squeezing' the rice into the ball.

{"src": "When we need to sneeze, how does looking into the light help?", "trg": "This only affects somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of the population. But essentially, nerves connecting to your brain from your nasal area that can detect a tickle are crossed with your optic nerves. (I've heard the term crossed, can anyone confirm? ) so when you see bright light, your brain thinks it detects a tickle in your nasal passages. A sneeze can be induced to clear out the particle that your brain thinks caused the tickle sensation."}

I've also never sneezed in my sleep that I'm aware of. Also being married for 15 years and having 2 kids, have never heard them sneeze in their sleep either. Maybe there is some reason that some people do and some don't."}
{"src": "Why do we use rubber belts for cars, driers, treadmills, vacuum cleaners etc. when used with motors instead of using chains like those on bikes and motorcycles. Wouldn't they last longer?", "trg": "Chains only last longer than belts when they are inside an enclosure where they can be kept clean and lubricated. In an exposed application a belt will usually last longer and needs less maintenance. In all of the products mentioned a chain could be used, but would significantly increase the manufacturing costs. Belts work well enough."}
{"src": "Why do we use rubber belts for cars, driers, treadmills, vacuum cleaners etc. when used with motors instead of using chains like those on bikes and motorcycles. Wouldn't they last longer?", "trg": "I think it's probably because belts are not as noisy, and the don't need any lubrication. A lot of cars use a toothed belt rather than a chain for the valvetrain. The chain itself may last longer than a belt would, but the wear on a toothed sprocket or gear would be much greater than a belt would cause. You might get twice as much life using a chain, but then the gears  &  stuff would need replacing as well, leading to a less cost-effective solution over the life of the machine."}
{"src": "Why do we use rubber belts for cars, driers, treadmills, vacuum cleaners etc. when used with motors instead of using chains like those on bikes and motorcycles. Wouldn't they last longer?", "trg": "Chains are more expensive, noisier, can cause critical damage if they fail, and probably most importantly of all they require regular lubrication. It's one thing asking a motorcycle owner to spray chain lube on the final drive chain every 1,000 miles or so, but expecting a car owner or vacuum cleaner owner to do the same is highly improbable."}
{"src": "Why do we use rubber belts for cars, driers, treadmills, vacuum cleaners etc. when used with motors instead of using chains like those on bikes and motorcycles. Wouldn't they last longer?", "trg": "For timing in cars, well designed (meaning well LUBRICATED) timing chains are still better than belts in my opinion. They last the life of the car, need no maintenance, and are not noticeably noisier than a belt. Belts break, and often cause internal engine damage. On the flip side, there are motorcycles that are belt driven as well. Smaller appliances use belts because they are low power and the rubber will hold up. Also belts require no lube, therefore no mess."}
{"src": "Why do we use rubber belts for cars, driers, treadmills, vacuum cleaners etc. when used with motors instead of using chains like those on bikes and motorcycles. Wouldn't they last longer?", "trg": "Just a guess, so correct me if I am wrong. It has to do with torsion and general movement of the individual parts. Using chains would require a much more rigid design and also require much higher tolerances of production of all the components. Tldr: it's just easier and more cost efficient to use belts."}
{"src": "Why do we use rubber belts for cars, driers, treadmills, vacuum cleaners etc. when used with motors instead of using chains like those on bikes and motorcycles. Wouldn't they last longer?", "trg": "Some old cars actually do use chains instead of belts. I've replaced a few integra timing belts and some of them seemed like they broke because oil from the engine leaked and got on them. If I could convert my honda engines to timing chains instead of belts, I would."}

The boat does not disturb water that is in front of, beside and underneath the boat. There is only a small line of a wake left almost directly behind the vehicle.

{"src": "Why do christians follow the King James bible when it was written 1600 years after Jesus?", "trg": "Most don't. The King James bible was the first English language bible so a lot of English Speakers used it. But there are numerous modern translations: New International Version (NIV), New King James Version (NKJV), New Revised Standard (NRS), and others. These more modern translations go to as old of text as they can get, (Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic) and translate them into the modern language. The reason that people read these is that most do not understand Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic."}

Having 500 car keys doesn't make the car work any better than having 1 car key though."}

Of course we all use personal protective equipment for cases like this (i.e gowns, mask, goggles, and gloves). To my understanding the strongest theory out there is that the employees who got infected were removing their own PPE the wrong way, probably something as simple as brushing the outside of their gown against their forearm. The problem with health care is people expect perfection when the grim reality is we can only hope for perfection."}

Want to ride Amtrak? Show up 2 minutes before the train arrives and get on. I haven't ever been on a cruise but I imagine they don't have real strict security either. I guess planes are more isolated in the air but I don't think that warrants the over-the-top security posture. I'd rather we just have more undercover air marshals than all the TSA agents in the airports."}

There was no need to invent stuff like pickling your vegetables or dry meats and sausages in the south. In the north it was because otherwise you'd starve to death. Clothes needed to be more robust. Houses as well. You had to get more yield out of land. All of this combined for culture of innovation and invention at a more desperate need than in warm climates."}

{"src": "In the US, why is it allowed to potentially expose your child and other's children to deadly diseases through vaccination exemptions but other state mandated laws, such as vehicle child restraints or smoking age-limits, are non-negotiable?", "trg": "It's because acts are not made illegal in relation to other acts. They're taken on a case by case basis and in the case of the child restraints and smoking age-limits, you had insurance lobbyists and mothers groups that convinced congress to act. Since it's such a hot-button issue, I'd bet that within 12 months we'll see a bill introduced that will make it more difficult, if not illegal, to opt out of vaccinating your children."}
{"src": "In the US, why is it allowed to potentially expose your child and other's children to deadly diseases through vaccination exemptions but other state mandated laws, such as vehicle child restraints or smoking age-limits, are non-negotiable?", "trg": "It is because we don't believe in forcing people to do things to themselves just to exist. I don't defend these parents, but I understand why we don't force people to put a needle in their arms. You don't have to drive to live, nor do you have to smoke.

{"src": "why do tire treads lead to more traction when there is less surface area touching the road?", "trg": "They don't. That's why car racing often uses \"racing slicks\". The problem is that if you get even a little bit of something between the tire and the road (e.g. rain water) that there isn't anywhere for it to go, and it forms a film between the tire and the road that prevents the tire from getting any traction."}
{"src": "why do tire treads lead to more traction when there is less surface area touching the road?", "trg": "Traction is mostly independent of area of contact so tread or no tread you get the same traction. If all other things are equal. But they aren't. As noted in several posts below, tread is mostly to give liquids and small gravel a place to go without disrupting your traction."}
{"src": "why do tire treads lead to more traction when there is less surface area touching the road?", "trg": "I am not sure if I understand the question but: 1. Tires without any tread definitely have more traction (note no tread, not bald tires) see: [Racing slicks]( URL_0 ) 2.

Tread design and materials are all various combinations of tradeoff in traction between surface conditions."}
{"src": "why do tire treads lead to more traction when there is less surface area touching the road?", "trg": "The grooves in the rubber are designed to allow water to be expelled from beneath the tire and prevent hydroplaning.

When he takes his glasses off his left eye stops looking forward at you and starts looking at 7'oclock and he can't move it or control it. But put the glasses back on and the eye drifts back up. It's odd."}

My older brother was diagnosed much older when he would refuse to sit anywhere but a few inches from the TV when watching. So, when I was born my parents saw signs they recognized from him and they just knew. Things like stuff not registering to me from far away. I don't know how they knew what prescription I needed, but that was how it happened with me. Been wearing some form of corrective lenses for 23 years since."}

{"src": "How does Nintendo's labo work?", "trg": "Remember the original Wiimote's motion functionality and its other accessories such as the crossbow, steering wheel, etc.? Well, the Labo are essentially cardboard accessories for the JoyCons that are a bit more exclusive to the compatible games. As you saw in the reveal trailer, it went to things such as a piano, a fishing rod, and a house; clearly much more exclusive accessories that work with only a single game. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's my take on it. We only had so much to work with."}
{"src": "How does Nintendo's labo work?", "trg": "If you watch the video closely you see that in all of the cardboard devices they Place one of the joycons in them. The joycons have gyro sensors in them and the red one has an IR sensor. These allow the movement of the cardboard devices to be translated to input for the games or applications, whatever you want to call them."}
{"src": "How does Nintendo's labo work?", "trg": "It's a mixture of the motion sensing in the joycons and the IR camera in the right joycon for certain things like noticing which piano key is hit. There's a surprising amount of tech in those little joycons"}
{"src": "If I close my eyes does my hearing ability improve because my brain has to process one sense less or is this just a placebo effect?", "trg": "Working memory can only handle a very small amount of information at a time, so closing your eyes does improve your hearing in the sense that it helps filter out distractions and increases recall for auditory information. Closing your eyes does not, however, increase the actual acuity of hearing."}
{"src": "If I close my eyes does my hearing ability improve because my brain has to process one sense less or is this just a placebo effect?", "trg": "I have very bad eyesight. My hearing gets really bad when i'm not wearing glasses, since I have to concentrate more on what I'm seeing. My mates laugh at me when I say, \"I can't hear coz I'm not wearing my glasses\"."}
{"src": "If I close my eyes does my hearing ability improve because my brain has to process one sense less or is this just a placebo effect?", "trg": "This same theory can also be applied to other senses. As a former drummer, some of my best practice sessions were when I focused only on the sense of touch with both earplugs and huge over-the-ear sound isolation headphones (to try to block out as much of my sense of sound as possible). The brain works in some very interesting ways."}
{"src": "If I close my eyes does my hearing ability improve because my brain has to process one sense less or is this just a placebo effect?", "trg": "It doesn't improve your hearing it allows the brain to focus on hearing. Try this, blind fold your partner, then put ear plugs (noise protection) in there ears so they can't hear. Then using a soft dry paint brush very slowly paint their exposed skin. This type of sensory deprivation forces the brain to only focus on the brush sliding on the skin. It can be a very intense experience for many people."}

{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "It's basically formed of dead white blood cells. When you get a wound that ends up being infected your body sends loads of white blood cells to target and eat the bacteria. Many of the white blood cells end up dying either due to old age or because the bacteria release chemicals that kill them. So it doesn't serve a 'function' so much as it is a by-product of some types of bacterial (or fungal) infection."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "It's like the cleanup after the war. You don't want any dead bodies lying around cuz then people would get sick. So you all put the corpses in one place and seal it off from the rest of the community. No one gets sick. And some outside force should drain the deadpool or else the dam might break and infect everyone."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "Pus is a mixture of bacteria, toxic proteins, dead tissue, and white blood cells. It's basically what's left after your body fights off an infection. In most cases the body will absorb the pus and dispose of it, but in some cases it can form an isolated abscess which the body cannot drain on its own."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "Not a doctor or anything, but I want to add that pus surrounds whatever the offending foreign body is. This allows it to be ejected from the body... Think popping a pimple. I once brushed my bare foot by a wicker basket. My toe hurt to walk on for weeks afterwards, but it looked normal. One day I squeezed it for a while and eventually out came a sliver of wicker. Hadn't even realized the connection until that point. My foot felt normal after that. Thank you pus."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "Pus is dead neutrophils (a type of white blood cell). They are one of the first to arrive at the scene of injury. They release cytokines to attract other white blood cells to the scene and thus amplify the immune response. Not only are they the first to respond, but they are also the first to die. When they die, they become pus! The yellow-greenish color comes from the copper in the neutrophils."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "OK. I'm going to actually explain this to a small child. The pus is there because when you get a cut there's bad germs and your body sends special white blood cells to the germs to kill it and keep your body safe. Then when the special white blood cells finish their job they turn into the pus."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "The green colour of pus comes from the enzyme myeloperoxidase, abundant in neutrophils: white blood cells that travel to inflamed tissues and attack bacteria. Advia blood analysers use myeloperoxidade to count neutrophils. I pity anyone that uses one of those piles of crap and has to deal with the arrogant reps. Gold standard white cell differential, my arse!"}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "A few years ago I was swimming in the sea in Croatia when I slammed my hand into a big sea urchin, covered in hundreds of brittle spines. Hurt like hell, couldn't get them out. Next day I was contemplating hospital or doctor treatment but I was on an island off another island so I left it. Anyway, it got red and infected on the third day and, due to the build up of a tiny bit of pus around each spine, I was able to squeeze them all out and it was like new the day after. Bodies are well designed."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "To be extremely blunt, it serves no purpose in healing wounds as anything other than a byproduct. Pus is, very simply, a bunch of goo that is made up of dead things that your body killed and some of the white blood cells that killed them."}
{"src": "What is pus and what function does it serve in healing wounds?", "trg": "A medical practice that should be considered more often is sterile maggot abridement in active infected open wounds. Wound cleansing by maggots is precise, sterile, and works 24/7 under special bandages."}
{"src": "Why do they call the sleeveless shirt wife beater a wife beater?", "trg": "My impression is that it is due to Marlon Brando's popular turn in the play and movie *A Streetcar Named Desire*. He wore that style of shirt and he was crude and beat his wife. The film is very well known and was widely seen in its time. His role in particular was iconic and Brando was nominated for an Oscar. It's affected the way actors depict crude people and wife-beaters ever since."}
{"src": "If the Food and Drug Administration is so particular about the well-being of the consumers, why is tobacco legal?", "trg": "The BATF has co trolling over tobacco, not the FDA. They don't have any say over it. It's the same reason that beer doesn't have a nutrition label. Government agencies are limited in the scope of their powers, they can't go regulate anything they feel like. The FDA can't regulate tobacco any more than the department of transportation can regulate shopping carts."}
{"src": "If the Food and Drug Administration is so particular about the well-being of the consumers, why is tobacco legal?", "trg": "The Commerce Clause of the US Constitution gives the Congress the ability to regulate trade between the states and internationally. This includes banning trade of certain items (a lot of commerce clause law in the 1950-80 butted up against freedom of speech arguments for pornography). So, basically tobacco products are legal because the Congress chose to not criminalize a petty vice that is a great source of sin tax revenue. I hear it also just grows outside in certain states, all natural."}
{"src": "If the Food and Drug Administration is so particular about the well-being of the consumers, why is tobacco legal?", "trg": "~~Corruption.~~ Lobbying. A lot of people with a lot of money put a lot of money in a lot of politicians' pockets to make sure tobacco stays legal (for some, not others) regardless of the actual consequences, so that they can make still more money from still more people."}
{"src": "How did they stop water to build the Hoover dam?", "trg": "First, they had to divert away the water. This is usually done by building a tunnel upstream and letting the water flow through it instead of the construction site. Next, they form the dam and let the concrete set for a couple of weeks. After the concrete is sufficiently strong, the tunnel is plugged up and the water is directed back to the dam."}
{"src": "Why does the auto industry hate that Tesla sells directly to the customer instead of going through a dealer?", "trg": "That should be pretty obvious... The dealers want their cut of the profit. -------------- This is a point I've tried to make for many, many years. A car is a Toaster. It's a product that can be sold at a Wal-Mart, at a cash register. Traditional car dealers don't want you to think like that."}
{"src": "Why does the auto industry hate that Tesla sells directly to the customer instead of going through a dealer?", "trg": "Thousands of people depend on jobs at car dealerships, and they get a cut of the money the buyer hands over when a car is sold. Cutting out that middle man means lower cost of cars, less people badgering you for the optional extras, but also redundant jobs. Basically, having no dealership is far better for the consumer, but they don't want you to know that."}
{"src": "Why does the auto industry hate that Tesla sells directly to the customer instead of going through a dealer?", "trg": "Because it does an end-run around the car dealership cartel. --------- car\u00b7tel / *noun* an association of manufacturers or suppliers with the purpose of maintaining prices at a high level and restricting competition."}
{"src": "Why does the auto industry hate that Tesla sells directly to the customer instead of going through a dealer?", "trg": "The traditional car industry operates similar to a cartel. From wikipedia: \"an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market.\" So if the dealers' association in a state is protesting the sale of Tesla cars without use of the cartel system of dealerships (limiting supply and access to control price) then competing companies will indeed work together to prevent competition to their profitable system."}
{"src": "How we all know who the mafia is and who belongs to which family what happens in the family but many still walk freely?", "trg": "Because you can't go to prison simply because the media or police suspect you belong to a crime family. They need to convince a jury that you've committed specific crimes. It's also worth noting that a lot of what we think we know about the current structure and membership of any given family is probably wrong or outdated. Joaquin Garcia noticed exactly this when infiltrating the mob for the FBI, and I believe Joe Pistone found the same thing."}
{"src": "How we all know who the mafia is and who belongs to which family what happens in the family but many still walk freely?", "trg": "It has to do with hierarchy. Look here  URL_0  Imagine you are a crime boss: you tell Billy (who you trust), to tell sammy (who billy trusts), to hire some schmuck (who doesn't really know anyone) to do some crime.

Less than that, you would need to feed bees syrup or sugar water to supplement the honey."}
{"src": "What will happen on Earth when galaxies collide?", "trg": "Galaxies are mostly empty space. The chance of a direct collision is actually fairly low, especially for outlying solar systems such as ours. Also, any \"collision\" wouldn't happen in the sense of two cars crashing into each other, for example - it would take millions of years for the collision to unfold completely. A human lifespan is nothing on that timescale."}
{"src": "What will happen on Earth when galaxies collide?", "trg": "Luckily we probably have nothing to worry about. Not for the reasons the other posters have stated (which are absolutely correct), but because the collision won't happen for another 4 billion years, and by then earth will already be a [life-less water-less desert wasteland]( URL_0 ) due to the natural life cycle of the sun. By then humans with either be extinct, or moved off planet, either of which means we wouldn't have to worry about it much."}

{"src": "Why do buildings have gravel on top of them?", "trg": "Another that Skeezy hints at but needs to be pointed out is that gravel is used versus some lighter material is to provide weight to hold the roof material down during high winds. Flat semi concrete panels can be used for same purposes as all listed and are more suited for times when roof will be used for higher traffic such as tenant use. Gravel just happens to be a cheap suitable material that provides for a lot of benefits."}
{"src": "Why do buildings have gravel on top of them?", "trg": "A flat roof has a rubber membrane adhered to the decking that waterproofs the roof. The roof will also have a slight slope so as to remove water. Gravel serves a couple purposes, 1) to protect the membrane from damage, 2) to provide a flat surface to walk on and place equipment like A/C pumps."}

{"src": "What makes walking on train tracks so dangerous? Couldn't the average person hear a train coming long before it reaches them?", "trg": "Some train tracks have a 3rd rail which is what powers the train. This is especially true of subway systems. While subway systems run mostly underground, they can extend far out into the suburbs running above ground. The 3rd rail is highly electrified and is not much different looking than a regular rail track."}
{"src": "What makes walking on train tracks so dangerous? Couldn't the average person hear a train coming long before it reaches them?", "trg": "In short, no. The days of trains going \"click click, click click, click click\" are long gone because the rails are now one smooth, welded piece with no visible seam. Combine this with the almost silent electric engine and a lack of attention, you probably wouldn't hear a train coming until it was too late. This is true in the UK at least."}
{"src": "What makes walking on train tracks so dangerous? Couldn't the average person hear a train coming long before it reaches them?", "trg": "Well, nowadays the danger is from kids taking a selfie of them trying to jump out of the train tracks right before the train hits them.

All a black hole is, is a massively dense clump of matter. It could be bright, or orange, or red for all we know, but it looks like a hole because it sucks up all the light that passes near it.

So like Drafterman said, they weren't ever intended to be secure."}
{"src": "Why are SSNs so damn insecure?", "trg": "Short answer: because it's being used in ways it wasn't designed for. Slightly longer answer: because a national ID card/number is incredibly useful but American paranoia prevented the creation of one. So all the industries and organizations that want to be able to differentiate one person from another wound up using the SSN for that, because it's the only de facto national ID number."}

As a response, Pepsi offers its products to restaurants at a reduced cost, which is why many restaurants carry it.

You go through different stages of sleep every night. You only dream in one of these stages.

Portugal and Spain were absolutely fascist. They just adapted fascism to their own cultures and thus differed somewhat from the Italian Standard.

{"src": "Why do sexual orientation studies primarily focus on gay men and not gay women?", "trg": "If the premise is true, it may be because masculinity is (in some cases) more rigidly defined, leading to a greater conflict between people who insist on traditional masculinity and males who don't adhere to it than between people who are fond of traditional femininity and females who don't adhere to it."}
{"src": "Why do sexual orientation studies primarily focus on gay men and not gay women?", "trg": "That study is lumps women and bisexuals together as an unaccessed group, so it is not clear how big the divide is when bisexuals are excluded. Also, research investigate difference between gay and straight populations might make a methodological decision to exclude bisexuals. Since female sexuality tends to be more flexible, a greater portion of women identify themselves as bisexual, which might cause more to be excluded from such studies."}

{"src": "Why is men's sport watched so so much more than women's?", "trg": "Because the male leagues are established and have some of the biggest names behind them. Womens sports are catching up, but the games are almost always scaled down versions of the same thing with lesser known athletes and advertising."}
{"src": "Why is men's sport watched so so much more than women's?", "trg": "With a few exceptions like the NCAA or the Olympics, men's sports are rarely just men's sports. They are the \"open\" competition that happens to be filled by men, because of biological realities. Women's sports specifically are for women. It's not surprising to see that the open competition with the best athletes in the world draws more attention than the competition that restricts one half of humans off of the bat, and then puts on an inferior product because of it."}
{"src": "Why is men's sport watched so so much more than women's?", "trg": "Women generally lack the athleticism that males do in some sports. Also by nature (as in its in their DNA) men are a bit more aggressive. This makes me s sports generally (again not always) more entertaining to watch. Also some sports such as football are just too dangerous for females and can't be played due to body structure without having the game severely muted in rules and effect."}
{"src": "Why is men's sport watched so so much more than women's?", "trg": "In the not-so-distant past, sport in general, and professional sport in particular, was seen as a male endeavour.

{"src": "Why do people stress eat?", "trg": "Eating, among other pleasureable things like having sex releases the hormone dopamine, also known as the pleasure hormone, that like you might have guessed makes you happy. The dopamine then relieves some of the stress, making you feel better by eating."}
{"src": "Why do people stress eat?", "trg": "I see everyone mentioning dopamine, but there are other factors as well. Stress increases cortisol production, and increased cortisol counteracts the activity of insulin while also increasing glycogen production. This will make the body think it needs to eat more to replenish the body, which is part of the link between stress and over-eating."}

Yeah, there might be one or two, but they have almost no listeners. Different audiences, different preferred formats."}
{"src": "Why isn't there a conservative version of the Daily show somewhere?", "trg": "something becomes funny, if it has something unexpected or surprising to it. that also means it has to bring something new or even innovative to your thoughts. i just guess this is kind of contrairy to a conservative point of view."}
{"src": "How are spiders able to crate webs from A to B if said points are two trees or poles several metres away from each other?", "trg": "They let out a web string and let it flow on the wind. The string is sticky, so as soon as it touches the other tree, it attaches there. Afterwards the spider can use that string as a base to create the rest of the web."}

I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the consensus seems to be that reason is profit-oriented, a very easy way to increase margins. my iPhone 4 just died so I am in the market for a new phone. the 5S is intriguing but I am going to do my research."}
{"src": "why do iPhone models increase in price by $100 from 16GB to 32GB when that same additional storage only costs $10 in flash drive form?", "trg": "It's a really great way to maximize profit. People are going to jump for that higher storage, and if it doesn't cost that much for YOU (the company), it's pure profit. Fast food does it all the time with super sizing. It costs the company BASICALLY NOTHING to give you that bigger meal, but you're like \"f*ck it I want my money's worth\" and buy the bigger size. Guaranteed profit."}
{"src": "[USA] If a state law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that state refuses to stop enforcing that law, what happens? How are SCOTUS rulings meant to be enforced in the event they are ignored or defied?", "trg": "The federal government can, and has, sent troops to enforce SCOTUS rulings (desegregation, for instance). I believe the federal government can also arrest and try members of the executive branch of the State government for their violations."}

{"src": "[USA] If a state law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that state refuses to stop enforcing that law, what happens? How are SCOTUS rulings meant to be enforced in the event they are ignored or defied?", "trg": "It's really almost identical to how the US govt handles countries that don't play nice with us: 1. Squeeze them economically but cutting off funding or sanctioning their local economy. 2. Threaten local political leaders with blacklisting or international/federal pressure to behave through threat of blacklist. 3. Use physical force in the are with either military or national guard."}
{"src": "[USA] If a state law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that state refuses to stop enforcing that law, what happens? How are SCOTUS rulings meant to be enforced in the event they are ignored or defied?", "trg": "In response to some of the answers below - withholding funding is one of the ways the feds manipulate state governments to comply with its wishes; but the feds may use federal troops to enforce federal law (there would be other ways too). There's a difference. And has already been stated, it is the Executive branch that would be responsible for enforcement, not the judiciary."}
{"src": "[USA] If a state law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that state refuses to stop enforcing that law, what happens? How are SCOTUS rulings meant to be enforced in the event they are ignored or defied?", "trg": "In most cases the general public will have an outcry, and the government will be forced to respond. Either that or they'll get voted out of office, or even impeached. If nobody cares, nothing happens. Usually when dealing with a state acting out of bounds, the federal government steps in someway. Usually sending in the national guard and forcing the enforcement."}
{"src": "In movies that involve an interrogation scene, why does the cop put his gun and badge on the table?", "trg": "Keeping in mind that doing something like that would probably cost an officer their job in real life, it's done in films when a police officer is going \"off the books\" as a \"good cop\" (opposed to bad cop who might threaten the person being interrogated). They're trying to show the other person that they're just an ordinary guy and not a threat."}

Proof: when polishing silver, the tarnish being removed is black silver sulphide, whereas silver oxide is white."}
{"src": "Why do public toilet seats have an opening at the front, but home toilet seats are completely round?", "trg": "International Plumbing Code and Uniform Plumbing Code in the US dictate that open front seats must be used for facilities that are made for Accessible Design. The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't require it but plumbing code does. Nobody really likes open front seats so you usually only see them in commercial applications in the US. Home use toilet seats are closed front because that is much more comfortable for non disabled users."}
{"src": "Why Google Chrome tabs can consume up to 100-150 megabytes of memory while many of them consist just of kilobytes of javascript?", "trg": "Much of the memory reported to you usually stems from shared memory. While the Tabs are sandboxed, there's still a lot of common in them, they share several system resources, which are shared, but show up as individually allocated pieces of memory in process lists. Don't worry, chances are good that those 150MB are allocated only once. A new tab is opened, and it will also be mapped that shared segment of 150MB = >  *Boom* another 150MB showing up, that are actually no additional weight."}

{"src": "Why is Scientology, with its heavy cult-like status, still allowed to carry on as a religion?", "trg": "It's pretty much the same for all religion openly practice in the US. Scientology is no different than any other religions. There is that old saying that say churches only allow what they can no longer forbid."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "It's actually quite the opposite. Your body is making a hell of a lot of noise (rest your head on someone's stomach some time), which your brain filters out. A disorder of the inner ear called superior canal dehiscence syndrome causes people to hear these sounds - including the sound of their eyeballs moving. Noises that aren't made internally (like tapping your teeth) pass through the solid matter in your head and manually stimulate the ossicles - which your brain can't filter out."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "Sound travels remarkably well through solid or semi-solid materials. Since your mouth and throat are very close to your timpanic membrane (eardrum), the sound waves are picked up even if they are very, very quiet. As a test - put your ear on one end of a long desk, and get someone to lightly tap the other end. You will be able to hear it. Sound travels fairly well through air, very well through liquids, and extremely well through solids."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "You should read up on Bone anchored hearing aids(BAHA). They work buy putting sounds through the skull. It will answer this question and it is pretty interesting. My cousin has one and it came with a little attachment that allows him to put it on your skull and you can hear through it."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "We have two routes for sound waves to reach the inner ear- through the external ear and through the skull. Anything in your mouth vibrates your bones and transfers sound waves up through your skull. Everything is in contact, so why would it be isolated?"}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "FYI: if you find it very difficult to hear people while you are chewing, you are a rare subset of the human population and most people can listen to others talking while they are eating just fine. It's genetic and originates from somewhere in Western Europe."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "The sound of your teeth tapping together vibrates through your skull, and is picked up by your eardrums much faster than sounds created externally. This is why you can still hear your voice when plugging your ears."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "The opposite is the case! And it's the same reason why you think you sound different on any recordings. Sound *waves* are *waves*, as the name would suggest, and they not only travel through air but also through any sort of material - like your body. Sound that is being produced by or in your body might not go outside but still *would* travel from your teeth right into your eardrum through your bones. Your bones and eardrum vibrate and your brain processes it as sound."}
{"src": "How are humans able to hear tiny sounds they make inside their body?", "trg": "Sounds travel through solids and liquids (and we are about 80% water) really well. Because those sounds originate from objects physically attached to us (specifically our ears, which are also attached to us) , it's completely normal that we are *more* likely to hear them than those around us."}
{"src": "How come video game characters render in the \"T\" position?", "trg": "Just a convention. Sometimes other poses are used. As far as I can tell, it just seemed to be a relatively convenient position that was roughly in the middle of motion ranges for most models, which helped with things like them not looking terrible. Take a look at some discussion threads on other sites to get a better explanation than what I can give.  URL_0 "}
{"src": "How come video game characters render in the \"T\" position?", "trg": "Aside from what a lot have said already, the T possition is also the position that many draw new characters in along with a front, 3/4ths and side position as well. They then give these concept characters to the modelers to work on and depending on the program they could if they wanted load the drawing into the 3d program to use as a template which makes it easier to match the details."}
{"src": "What specifically were white people afraid would happen if they used the same water fountain as black people?", "trg": "White supremacists had everyone believing that black folks were inferior, disgusting, half - beast people. In their minds, drinking from a black persons water fountain was like sticking your head in a horse trough."}
{"src": "What specifically were white people afraid would happen if they used the same water fountain as black people?", "trg": "It was not fear, or superstition that created these policies, (though certainly some individuals actually believed this) it was simply a means to control and assert dominance over another group. There were many similar myths propagated to support slavery as well, they were lies told to justify the exploitation of others."}
{"src": "Why isn't sheet music just the letter notes versus the way that it is written", "trg": "If you are playing a chord -- that is, multiple notes at the same time -- it's much easier to represent that visually on a staff. Also, there can be multiple instruments/voices written on the music. So, writing the letters doesn't work all that well. Also, I can tell you as someone who sang for years in choirs without any instrumental training, that the musical notation gives me a sense of the interval between my current and next note, even if I have no idea what the actual note I am singing is."}
{"src": "Why isn't sheet music just the letter notes versus the way that it is written", "trg": "In addition to what everyone else has said you should also note (hehe) that there are multiple instances of each letter. A musical staff has more than one a note or g note and if you just used the letter it would be confusing which one."}
{"src": "Why isn't sheet music just the letter notes versus the way that it is written", "trg": "Because there is a lot more information being communicated. Yes you are reading the note name (letter note as you put it), but you are also reading its relation to the chord/key signature, its duration, the style that it is suppose to be played in, the tempo it is suppose to be played in, what octave the note is in, and many more things."}

Many congrats on your little boy."}
{"src": "If some people can live without parts of their brains, why do people instantly die when they're shot in the head?", "trg": "Not everyone instantly dies with a head shot. Famous recent example: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords took a bullet right through the head and out the other side. She lost brain tissue but luckily the bullet did not sever the most vital parts of the brain, the ones you can't live without or the ones that would cause her to bleed out instantly. She is alive and recovering well."}
{"src": "If some people can live without parts of their brains, why do people instantly die when they're shot in the head?", "trg": "There are (rare) instances where someone can live despite being shot in the head. The issue is that the bullet is going to do incredible damage to the brain, once it hits the scull it will break up and scatter shrapnel throughout the brain itself. Its not just as if they leave a perfect bullet shaped hole in your head."}
{"src": "If some people can live without parts of their brains, why do people instantly die when they're shot in the head?", "trg": "Because a bullet is a little more violent than a scalpel. Bullets cause hydrostatic shock, a shock wave that travels though the liquids in the body, that can burst cells. They also burst blood vessels in the brain, which can either starve or put excess pressure on brain tissues."}

It looks like normal food, but it isn't. It mimics food but still makes you sick. From the inside and the outside it appears to just be normal food but there is just SOOOOO much of it that it makes you sick. You can't seem to stop getting fed and finally your system just shuts down. Hope that helps."}

So without further ado, I'd like to present our host for this evening, Mr. Elmer Fudd:  URL_0  The purpose of Wall Street is to help facilitate the flow of capital between those with the money to invest and those who need that capital to expand or modernize."}
{"src": "What do people on Wall street actually do?", "trg": "What they're supposed to do, and some still do is connect inventors, entrepreneurs and businesses with capital to build the business. What a lot of them do is speculation on prices (e.g. buy a stock now with the expectation that it will be priced higher a year from now/tomorrow/ten seconds from now/etc..), although if the market rewards them with money then I suppose it finds this activity useful."}
{"src": "What do people on Wall street actually do?", "trg": "People who work on walstreet manage money. Just like a farmer wakes up early and counts the eggs and chickens and keeps them safe from foxes. Someone who works on walstreet manages money.

{"src": "Why is the United States so hesitant with Stem Cell treatment when it, so clearly, could revolutionize modern medicine as we know it?", "trg": "Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research is ethically and politically controversial because it involves the destruction of human embryos, since the embryonic stem cells, being so early in development, are able to differentiate into any type of cell unlike type-limited pluripotent stem cells in later stages of life. As a matter of religious faith and moral conviction, some people believe that \u201chuman life begins at conception\u201d and that an embryo is therefore a person"}
{"src": "Why is the United States so hesitant with Stem Cell treatment when it, so clearly, could revolutionize modern medicine as we know it?", "trg": "The United States is peculiar in that there are a significant number of people who care more about human embryos than actual humans. In fact, once you're old enough to go die in a war your life has lost all the holiness it once had. Life is most sacred when it's an embryo or a foetus, and least sacred when you're ready to go die in Iraq or if you turn out gay or worse."}
{"src": "Why is the United States so hesitant with Stem Cell treatment when it, so clearly, could revolutionize modern medicine as we know it?", "trg": "Something else to remember is that embryos are not the only source for stem cells for research, they can be derived from adipose and other kinds of tissues, too. There is a lot of stem cell research that is conducted everyday with these cells, and there are several treatments in use that employ them."}

{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "They *can*. They just **don't**, because doing so is a security risk. If a hacker tries a username and password and gets back \"username is invalid\", they'll move on to another username instead of wasting time on one that doesn't exist. And if they get back \"password is invalid\", they know that they have a real account, and can focus on trying to hack it. It's more secure to never confirm or deny that an account exists."}
{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "They are trying to make it harder for hackers.

{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "- Easier to code (something went wrong but we don't bother to differentiate the cases) - Security (getting the whole username/password combination right is harder than guess just one of these) - Privacy (people might know your usernames / emails but you don't always want them to know that you have an account on \"that\" website)."}
{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "Cause they don't know who you are until you login correctly. Some sites will tell you if the username doesn't exist, but if you enter a valid username and incorrect password, how does the site know if the username you entered belongs to you or if you entered yours incorrectly but it just so happens to be somebody else's?"}
{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "They can, and some websites do. It's actually really stupid not to because on many websites that don't specify which is wrong, they let you check which usernames are taken in the user creation page so it's not providing any extra security. If you want the extra security you need to not give username info anywhere on the site to make it not discoverable and most websites do not do that."}
{"src": "For most websites, when you enter your login info incorrectly, why can't the website tell you specifically whether the username or the password is incorrect?", "trg": "Security. If someone unauthorized was trying to access your account, telling them that one piece of information is incorrect already implies that the *other* piece of information **is correct**. For websites that use email logins, the email is already something likely to be widely known or searchable. This makes it all the more important to obscure the results of a login failure."}

{"src": "How does a spinning drum of concrete keep it from hardening?", "trg": "Nobody here has yet mentioned *how* spinning the drum mixes the concrete. It's because the inside wall of the drum has a big metal spiral on it. When the drum spins, the spiral spins, continuously pushing concrete to the front of the drum. Spinning the drum the opposite direction will push concrete to the back - this is how they pump the concrete out at the construction site without needing to tilt the mixer like a dump truck.

The higher the bomb, the further the EMP reaches. The atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were detonated so close to the ground that anything that could have experienced the EMP, was obliterated."}
{"src": "If a nuclear weapon creates an EMP, why didn't the planes dropping them in WWII experience it?", "trg": "They probably *did* experience it to a small degree, but keep in mind that the WWII nukes were tiny in comparison to modern ones. Hirhoshima blast was 16 kilotons, while modern nukes are in the hundreds of kilotons (and sometimes megaton) ranges. We also have much more electronics and wireless communication than during WWII, making modern technology more vulnerable to EMP than before. It's conceivable than a WW2 plane could keep flying even with all electronics completely disabled."}
{"src": "If a nuclear weapon creates an EMP, why didn't the planes dropping them in WWII experience it?", "trg": "Their electronics did get hit. Most of the plane was operated with mechanical controls, and what few electronics they had were insulated and of high gaged wires capable of handling the EMP. Modern electronics which have much smaller circuits and microchips are more vulnerable than the older tech."}

{"src": "How do we know that there is an infinite number of digits in pi? Is it possible that it's actually just a really big but finite number?", "trg": "In mathematics, unlike in more concrete fields of study, we can prove things without a doubt in various ways. Pi has been proven to be an irrational number in several different proofs. One of the properties of irrational numbers is that their decimal representation has an infinite number of digits.

That means if *x* is rational, there exists integers *a* and *b* such that *a*/*b* = *x*. To prove a number is irrational, and thus cannot be expressed as a terminating or repeating decimal, all you have to do is prove that no *a* and *b* exist for that number.

I wake up completely disoriented after naps sometimes, but generally speaking, after a full nights sleep I feel fine."}
{"src": "Why does sleeping for 8 hours feel like only 5 minutes?", "trg": "Your consciousness, the system of bodily functions you call \"you\", completely shuts down. Just like when you die. This \"you\" does not exist while you're asleep, that's why you can't notice the missing time. When the body wakes up, a new \"you\" gets started. As all instances of this \"you\" have access to the same sensory organs and the same memory, an illusion of continuity and unity from day to day is created."}

{"src": "Why does sleeping for 8 hours feel like only 5 minutes?", "trg": "The only time sleeping feels so short is when I drink. Otherwise I have very vivid dreams and I wake up thinking what happened in the dream is real. It doesn't help that most of my dreams are very realistic."}
{"src": "If female orgasms last so much longer then males, why do men think/want sex so much more?", "trg": "It's not just about the orgasm. The sex thought process is also driven by the biological need to procreate and produce the next generation. Women are fertile a few days of the month, but men are fertile pretty much all the time, and a guy can fertilize many many women. So biologically men's sex drive is higher and they think of it more often. And yes, there are lots and lots of individual exceptions. This is from a general trend perspective."}
{"src": "If female orgasms last so much longer then males, why do men think/want sex so much more?", "trg": "While there may be some biological differences, a lot of it comes from our culture. If you tell one group of people: 'your worth is tied up in how much sex you can have' and tell another group: 'your worth is tied up in abstaining from sex', who do you think is going to think about and admit to thinking about sex more? Additionally, more women are on drugs that lower the sex drive (namely hormonal contraceptive and SSRIs)"}
{"src": "If female orgasms last so much longer then males, why do men think/want sex so much more?", "trg": "They don't. There is just as much variance in libido within men as there are within women and the ranges are almost the same between the genders. If there is a difference it is very slight and mostly due to hormonal birth control. Most of the idea that men think of sex more is a social construct that is false."}
{"src": "If female orgasms last so much longer then males, why do men think/want sex so much more?", "trg": "There was a study that stated that men and women think about sex just as much as the other. Due to cultural influences when a woman expresses her sexual desire she is seen as a slut (or some other shaming word) and when a man does the same thing they are not looked at in such a way. So as a result women tend to be less vocal about their sexual desire making it seem that they think/want less sex. Also I do not believe there is a connection between orgasm length and sexual desire."}
{"src": "If female orgasms last so much longer then males, why do men think/want sex so much more?", "trg": "This goes against the general train of thought in these posts, but I think that men *do* think about sex more. Consider the behavior of gay men versus lesbian women. Gay men are much more sexually active. I think that the traditional idea that women are more selective in regards to sex because they are the ones who get pregnant may sound hackneyed, but is basically correct."}

{"src": "Why doesn't the body use up its fat reserves before it gets hungry and dizzy?", "trg": "Historically, fat was meant for emergencies only. A last-ditch reserve to maintain life when food is scarce. The hunger motivates you to eat so you don't have to dip into this emergency reserve. The dizziness is because you take as little energy out of your reserves as is needed to maintain life. Having low energy makes you feel dizzy and faint. Your body doesn't know whether you're going a few hours without food or a few days, so it plans on the worst case scenario."}
{"src": "Why doesn't the body use up its fat reserves before it gets hungry and dizzy?", "trg": "Fat is meant as an emergency energy store, a relic of a time when eating every day was by no means guaranteed and you had to have some way to keep energy around between infrequent meals. Burning through your emergency stores when food is plentiful is a bad idea, so we don't do that even now when there are more obese people in the world than starving people."}
{"src": "How come low unemployment rates don't directly translate into higher wages?", "trg": "With high unemployment rates, you have a lot more people all looking for the one job you have to offer so you don't necessarily have to offer high wages.

{"src": "How come low unemployment rates don't directly translate into higher wages?", "trg": "It does sometimes but you either have to have basically 100% employment or a skill shortage meaning you have to pay more to attract people away from other jobs.

ADR is used in cases where the production audio is too noisy, or otherwise unusable (bad line reading, airplane fly-by, etc.) MOST dialogue is caught with a shotgun microphone on a boom pole or the actor has a hidden lav microphone on their body. Since most productions are shot in a quiet and sound controlled environment, ADR really isn't necessary. The added difficulty and expense make it really a poor choice for primary audio."}

But, if you recently blew your load and are hoping for another decent size one with little time, just try and stay hard for like an hour or two before you bust and it should help some."}

{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "Ignore all these other idiotic reasons. The real reason: Drunk drivers cause accidents that society wants to prevent. Historically, the only way to prevent people from drinking and driving is to punish them if they do so. Its a solution to a problem. Allowing people to avoid punishment with an excuse does not serve society, so that excuse is not allowed."}
{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "Very similar questions: Two consenting adults (m,f) have sex. Both equally drunk.

{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "Both laws are punishing people who put others at risk, either by driving drunk or raping a drunk person. Punishing a drunk rape victim is tantamount to punishing a sober driver who was hit by a drunk driver. The drinking isn't the problem; the behavior that follows is. If you can't drink without driving intoxicated or raping someone, maybe don't drink."}
{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "It's a load of horse shit driven by the need for people to have an excuse for their actions instead of taking responsibility.

There is no way anyone could convince me that you can't give consent if you're drunk. Yes mean yes."}
{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "Consent for sex isn't a question of fault, it is a question of a potential victim's capability.

The answer is yes just like if they drove drunk."}
{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "In the case of sexual assault the perpetrator cannot claim that they are not responsible because they are drunk, just like they cannot claim they are not responsible for driving drunk. The victim's are not responsible for what happens to them because of the actions of the perpetrator."}
{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "Because when you're coerced into having sex when you're drunk presumably someone in a clearer state of mind is taking advantage of your inebriated state of mind.

Needless to say the judge ruled that if you can engage in commerce, you are not too drunk to consent."}
{"src": "Why are drunk people not able to make conscious sexual decisions but DWI is a conscious decision?", "trg": "DWI is not a conscious decision. In fact in most jurisdictions the offense of DWI does not require a conscious mental state. Most criminal statutes require that a person have a certain mental component such as knowingly, intentionally, negligently, etc. DWI generally does not have this. In my jurisdiction the mens rea is specifically excluded by statute and the defense of involuntary intoxication is not available."}

This causes the rumbling feeling. Also you would be hypoglycemic, causing your brain to not get the supply it's demanding, making you lightheaded. Along with that, in a starved state your body starts to break down fat and protein, changing the pH of your blood. All those reasons and a lot of other metabolic changes cause you to feel sick."}

It's often considered inappropriate for elected officials to intervene directly in law enforcement issues, because this can be perceived as the government inappropriately favoring or disfavoring individuals for political reasons. Answering questions on diplomatic issues, meanwhile, could compromise relationships or bargaining positions with other countries."}

{"src": "why am I exhausted when my alarm goes off at 7am, but when I get up to go to the bathroom at 5am, I'm wide awake?", "trg": "Because at 5am you are probably not in a deep REM pattern sleep, so when you wake at 5 you are not feeling like you're still asleep..as you go back to sleep after you pee you go back to sleep and you're probably entering your deep REM when the alarm goes off at 7...which is why you feel like you are exhausted."}

I've read that if you ever wake up from a blacked-out state of drinking, and you feel extra alert at like 4 or 5 am, after 3 hours sleep, with seemingly no hangover yet; it is because your body has been breaking down alcohol into sugars while you were asleep.

If Fredonia says no, all the US can do is expel him from the country. If Fredonia waives immunity, then he can be charged just like anyone else."}

But when you view the full screen, you can see everything sorta comes together to make one big picture. The same principle applies with these new uniforms. Up close, they look like a glitched out game boy screen, but from a distance, the uniform more easily blends in with the surroundings."}

{"src": "How \"Haaaa\" produces warm air, yet \"Whoo\" produces cool air from your mouth?", "trg": "The air that exits your mouth is both at the same temperature. However there is a windchill effect. If there is no air movement your skin will heat up the surrounding air and create a warm layer of air around your body. However if there is some draft it will blow away this layer of air and replace it with colder air. The more wind there is the colder it feels.

Try saying haaaaa very quickly with a quicker breath of air. Same sound, different temperature. The same works for saying whooo slowly with a start from the diaphragm and full outblow."}
{"src": "How \"Haaaa\" produces warm air, yet \"Whoo\" produces cool air from your mouth?", "trg": "\"Haaa\" requires you to spread your lips wide and blow gently; that means that warm air from your lungs is moving slowly and so feels warm. \"Whoo\" requires you to purse your lips, meaning that warm air from your lungs is moving quickly over your lips, which feels cold via the same mechanism that wind feels cooler than the air it's made of."}

Water also has around 4X the specific heat of air, so a given mass of water has about 4X the energy of the same mass of air (at a given temperature). So there's about 4000X more *energy* nearby to burn you. Note, you would eventually cook in a sauna."}

This gives you an image which shows the precise location of the tumor. Generally, healthy cells in the affected area are also removed, since it's better to cut them out than to let some cancer cells survive. After that, radiation and chemo therapy is used to kill of remaining cells, before they can grow into a tumor themselves."}
{"src": "How can tumors be removed surgically if the tumor's exact borders/perimeters can only be seen with a microscope?", "trg": "The difficulty in removing a tumor is a large part a team effort between surgeon and pathologist. Often surgeons will start removing tissue and send off small samples of hypothesized borders of tumors to pathologists who can quickly analyze the tissue and inform the surgeon the grade of the tumor be it malignant or benign and if more tissue needs to be removed. It's a delicate process and the procedure and success rate is highly depend on tissue and organs involved."}

Then, when the bridge was finished, they just let the water flow.  & nbsp; This is also why you often see rivers around old castles: originally that was just a river, but they dug around, changed the flow, built a bridge, and removed the obstacle; that's how they made it loop around the building."}

First they blocked off the water around where they were going to dig and build using what are called Cofferdams or Caissons made of pile driven wood or stone and pumped out by bucket, dug the foundation and built to the water line and then removed the temporary structure.

{"src": "If Google's automated cars ever become a thing, how is responsibility divided up in the case of an accident?", "trg": "The way it could work is that the car manufacturer or the company that provides the AI would also provide the insurance for the car which would be factored in to the price of the car. Car owners would no longer need to purchase insurance of their own. The determination of which vehicle is at fault would work the same way.

Farms raise turkeys year round, with only 2 days a year when they are needed. Christmas and Thanksgiving. Chicken meat is more expensive, because after a chicken reaches a certain age, the meat quality is less desirable. I. E. After 2 months old, chicken meat becomes tough. Turkeys, on the other hand, you can get much better return on investment., since the breast part is more desirable, and turkey breasts are bigger than chicken breasts."}

The Americas only had the llama, which was still hard to domesticate. Because of the possibility of domesticating animals, communities grew larger, because more food was available.

{"src": "Why did European/Asian nations develop faster than the native Americans?", "trg": "I would say that great strides in progress come from being disadvantaged. Europe stripped much of their resources, their population grew and became crowed, and there was a lack of human comfort.

In the agricultural revolution of the 50s and 60s wheat was cross bred to create shorter strains, therfore reducing the height of the wheat and increasing potential yield. Wheat was so tall it would tend to fall and rot when moisture got to it. Having a shorter height avoided loss of potential yield. All this is of course an addendum to other comments regarding detection, recording, incidence and increased awareness."}

{"src": "Why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like Dell, HP, Alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and RAM?", "trg": "My ELI5 answer to this is : Because of all parts to upgrade in a computer the CPU is the most difficult to replace, and the most daunting for a person with little experience to replace. RAM and video cards are literally put in, latch, and boot your computer. Buy a computer with a good CPU and you can keep it for many years without worrying about motherboard and other compatibility issues."}
{"src": "Why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like Dell, HP, Alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and RAM?", "trg": "You have to remember who they are selling them to. People that are knowledgeable about what makes a good gaming computer are just going to build their own. Anyone looking for a pre-built computer is likely to think a killer processor is the most important part. They also aren't going to know a lot about how RAM works or what a good video card is."}
{"src": "Why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like Dell, HP, Alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and RAM?", "trg": "Power video cards are more expensive, use more power and consequently require more powerful and expensive power supply units. Also, in terms of marketing, and i7 is clearly more powerful than an i5 or i3. On the other hand, the average consumer can't tell if a 960 is better or worse than a 780. Tldr: Easier to pad the marketing material to make a computer look more powerful by just using a more expensive CPU than an expensive video card."}

Wow! Must be a really good computer! 3 weeks later, they start complaining about it being slow, because it only has 2GB of RAM which they didn't notice. Prebuilt sucks. You can get the same thing 3x cheaper with better, quality parts. Prebuilt usually uses really crap motherboards as well, so they never last as long as something that's been built by you or someone for you."}
{"src": "Why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like Dell, HP, Alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and RAM?", "trg": "Because they are marketed toward people who don't know much about computers and those people have been taught to believe that better processors equate to better performance. The same with Ram. While shopping people will normally ask 'How much Ram does this have?' Even though they have no idea how much Ram they need. They just know more is better. It doesn't help that naming patterns on various components are meant to make things much harder than they should be."}

In reality it's just commercial gimmick that will sell you those upgraded parts for more than what they're worth.

{"src": "Why is it that every time we put something down our throat toothbrush, finger etc. we start to gag but when we but food and water down our throat we don't gag at all?", "trg": "It's because you make a conscious swallowing action, which starts the peristaltic movement in the esophagus, moving food downwards.

Raise your eyebrows like you're surprised and put your hand on top of you head. Do you feel your scalp move? They're there, but you just don't use those muscles. When you set your hair a certain way and don't move it, those muscles settle in that position. When you try and shift your hair (and thus move those muscles in ways it rarely does), it responds in a way any muscle would. It hurts. You're stretching a muscle that's not used to moving that way."}
{"src": "Why does moving my hair sometimes hurt my scalp if I haven't showered?", "trg": "The putty analogy someone used is pretty good explanation for the pain. This happened to me all of the time until I figured out how to take care of my hair. Shampoos  &  conditioners with sulfate strip your scalp so it produces more oil to compensate. Switching to a sulfate free shampoo is gentler on the scalp and will allow your scalp to produce oil normally. Then you can go without washing your hair for a couple of days and not get the \"hurty hair\"."}
{"src": "Why does moving my hair sometimes hurt my scalp if I haven't showered?", "trg": "your hair (and skin to a lesser degree) collects matter in your environment (smog and dirt in the air).

{"src": "If women receive less than men for the same job, why don't companies just hire women?", "trg": "A factor that may or may not play into it, is cost of benefits.

I wish I still had the chart we used to have at work for it, but it was astounding the cost difference.

{"src": "If women receive less than men for the same job, why don't companies just hire women?", "trg": "I think it's because women are *also* seen as being inferior in the workplace in comparison to men.

{"src": "Why do countries like Russia have harsher winters than other countries which are on the same latitude?", "trg": "Because Russia has huge landmass with very little ocean contact. Conversely, the southern hemisphere has a lot of ocean area with relatively little land. The ocean and its currents hold and move a lot of heat around the globe. Without proximity to the heat held in the ocean during the winter, Russia cools more drastically. On the other side, the southern hemisphere experiences smaller temperature swings with the seasons."}

{"src": "Why are plays considered to be literature, but film scripts are not?", "trg": "As a writer, I'm just gonna say that the biggest reason is that a script is ultimately a blue print, no matter how beautifully written, and simply a step in a larger process involving many artists, a bunch of luck, random money problems, editing choices, the list goes on and on. A script isn't necessarily reflective of the film that's made from it. Whereas the writing of a play very often has more control over how the final product is executed."}
{"src": "Why are plays considered to be literature, but film scripts are not?", "trg": "Film scripts are literature. The difference is that films are produced once, while plays are generally produced several times throughout the years. So there is less reason to mass produce film scripts than there is to mass produce play scripts. This leads to more people reading plays like books or studying them in high school/college."}
{"src": "Why are plays considered to be literature, but film scripts are not?", "trg": "Plays are meant to be performed regularly by different groups of people. As a result, plays are published and, if popular, widely read. A film script, on the other hand, is meant to be performed and filmed one time. As a result, scripts are not frequently published or widely read, regardless of how popular the film was."}

{"src": "In English, why is \"I\" capitalized, but not \"me\"?", "trg": "Okay so I might be wrong on this, but I'm pretty sure it's because \"I\" is seen as a proper noun in English, because you do not utilize your own name in most common dialogue. \"Me\" is not capitalized because it is a pronoun, just like he, she, and they. I hope that made sense. (And I hope I'm correct.)"}
{"src": "In English, why is \"I\" capitalized, but not \"me\"?", "trg": "Because I is first person subjective - it is personal, closer to our sense of identity and therefore more important to us. \"Me\" is 3rd person objective - which feels farther from our sense of identity, speaking of ourselves as more of an object than a subject, which feels less important."}

How does that workout?", "trg": "a 10% discount on the customer's price is a  > 10% loss of profit because costs remain fixed. If the sale price is $1 and my fixed costs are $0.50, a 10% sale cuts profit by 20%. Such a sale wouldn't be worth it unless it causes sales to increase by 25%. The fact that you would need to increase sales by 40% implies that a 10% discount on price amounts to just under a 30% loss of profit which means that internal costs make up about 2/3 of your sale price."}

If the phone companies could detect you were spoofing, spoofing would not be possible. Much of this is because phone networks are very poorly designed, and largely based on obsolete standards from 30+ years ago to maintain backwards compatibility.

{"src": "How does a bladeless fan work?", "trg": "As many have said - there are blades they are just in the turbine that resides in the base.

The rubbing transfers the graphite from the paper onto the eraser, leaving the paper relatively undamaged."}
{"src": "Why are erasers made of rubber, and what makes them able to erase graphite?", "trg": "It is a friction thing mostly. The friction from rubbing the eraser across the paper causes it to warm up slightly, this causes the rubber to become sticky. At the same time, this friction loosens the graphite from the paper fibers and allows it to stick to the rubber. This friction also weakens the surface of the rubber so that enough rubbing will cause small bits of it to roll up and tear off. Thus exposing fresh rubber for more graphite to stick to."}

{"src": "Why are adults woken up automatically when they need to pee, while young children pee the bed?", "trg": "Haven't seen the right answer. ELI5: When you are born using the restroom is entirely controlled by the autonomic nervous system, pressure from urine against the bladder triggers stretch receptors to send signals to the brain that direct the child to pee. As you age, a new neural connection develops where these signals are routed to the frontal cortex, which is under conscious control, allowing you to keep your external urinary sphincter contracted until you actually wish to pee."}
{"src": "Why are adults woken up automatically when they need to pee, while young children pee the bed?", "trg": "Not an expert but I think is an learning proces like everything else. An unknowing child (like an *primitive* horse for example) do not care where they pee or anything.

{"src": "Why are adults woken up automatically when they need to pee, while young children pee the bed?", "trg": "Babies don't have control over their sphincters, just as they don't have very good coordination.

{"src": "How do cellphones communicate over such long distances with such a small antenna while my router barely can cover my house?", "trg": "Two reasons: * WiFi typically operates at 100 mW, cell phones are allowed to transmit up to 2000 mW. * WiFi operates at a higher frequency, which is blocked more easily by walls, etc. These are intentional. Wifi links have been established by hobbyists using souped- up routers over long distances (miles), but that defeats the purpose of home use, because if all routers reached that far, they'd all interfere with each other, making the connection slow."}
{"src": "How do cellphones communicate over such long distances with such a small antenna while my router barely can cover my house?", "trg": "Cell phones really don't travel **that** far because there are cell towers everywhere. These towers are very tall, which allows them to pick up the very faint signals of cell phones around them. The size of the antenna isn't really relevant to reception. The placement of antennae (up high and without obstruction)are the important parts. Wifi routers operate on very high frequencies (2.4 gigahertz) which are more easily absorbed by walls,which is why they don't always cover a big house."}

Tons of care and attention goes into antenna location, positioning, and characteristics. The physical size of the antenna is mostly a function of the frequencies being used, which are high, thus the small antennas."}
{"src": "How do cellphones communicate over such long distances with such a small antenna while my router barely can cover my house?", "trg": "The bottom line is, your cellphone operates on a frequency that can transmit to a cellular radio tower.

I don't know a ton of details on that end but I know my pharmacy has dropped a couple of plans because what they wanted to pay us for drugs was literally less than the cost to acquire them from our (or any) wholesaler, and that's before you even consider the cost of actually dispensing it."}
{"src": "Why am I compelled to buy health insurance but doctors are not compelled to accept it?", "trg": "Because insurance companies lobbied the government to force taxpayers to pay extra.

By creating social norms you control the behavior of the people within a society, and deviance from those norms cause the people to look at you for answers, imbuing you with power in the process.

{"src": "Why can't members of Congress and the Senate vote remotely?", "trg": "Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution specifically allows Congress to compel the attendance of absent members, and to determine the rules for proceedings, which presumably include in-person attendance.

Every month they seem to go on a 6-day or 6- week vacation.

Why would we let them not even appear for voting, do you want them never to show up to work ever?"}
{"src": "Why can't members of Congress and the Senate vote remotely?", "trg": "Several reasons: 1. Tradition 2. Verification/security concerns It's much cheaper and efficient to verify someone voting in person than it is to verify someone voting remotely. It's kind of like college students taking a test online: how do we know people are who they say they are? What about hackers or other attempts to tamper with the voting program(s)? You don't have those issues when conducting an in-person vote."}

{"src": "Why does the feeling of 'love' quite literally feel so heavy in your chest?", "trg": "The feeling of \"love\" is your body's response to hormones (serotonin/dopamine) when forging a connection with someone (strongest when it's a new someone). Because each person's body can be slightly different, each person will experience something slightly different.

{"src": "Why does it feel like less effort to watch 3 - hour long TV episodes back to back than a film?", "trg": "Movies and tv shows are, essentially, structured the same way. There is the introduction, a problem, a solution to aforementioned problem, then a major problem and then the major resolution (normally). In watching a movie you follow the one storyline.

That single note will also have 3rds, 5ths, 7ths, etc mixed in with it that give it that timbre. Otherwise you would only have a simple sine wave and everything would sound identical. This is also not taking into account how the sound waves bounce and refract off of surfaces and the . return back to your ear at different times."}

How do notes differ with each instrument, but retain the characteristics of its assigned pitch?", "trg": "I know this has already been answered, but I wanted to simplify it a bit. An easy way to think of it is: pitch is how quickly the the sound wave is repeating, whereas, the *way* it sounds is determined by the *shape* of the sound wave. Yes there are a lot of other factors that play into the timbre of a sound, but the most important element of what makes a violin sound like a violin, etc. is its unique sound wave."}

{"src": "Why are there separate prices for different age groups?", "trg": "In economics, its called third degree price discrimination. Basically, you're segmenting your market into groups, and charging each segment what they're willing to pay for whatever you're selling.

{"src": "Why do infants lose their minds when they're tired instead of just falling asleep?", "trg": "They actually don't know HOW to go to sleep. When an adult is tired, they understand that they can lie down, close their eyes and likely drift into sleep.

{"src": "How Felix Baumgartner broke the sound barrier if humans have a terminal velocity of around 175 MPH?", "trg": "It's really quite simple. As you ought to know, the earth's gravity pulls everything down at 9.8 m/s/s, aka 1G. The only reason why there exists a terminal velocity is because of air resistance. Remove the atmosphere and any item falling to earth will keep on accelerating at 1G until it hits the ground. Since Felix jumped at such a high altitude that air resistance played almost no role whatsoever, he was able to keep accelerating at around 1G for over 30 seconds."}
{"src": "How Felix Baumgartner broke the sound barrier if humans have a terminal velocity of around 175 MPH?", "trg": "One of the factors you use when calculating terminal velocity is the amount of resistance air has when you fall (drag) Because he started his jump at the edge of space, it starts off with virtually no drag, so he's able to accelerate to ridiculous speeds before he gets to a more normal drag."}

{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "Hairlessness allows us to regulate our body heat more easily.

{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "I've not read yet about the \"swimmer\" hypothesis. Humans are pretty good swimmers and divers, and can hold our breathe well and other random stuff. There is an hypothesis, that we spent some time evolving near water, and relatively less hair is an adaption for that. EDIT: [Here's the wikipedia article about it]( URL_0 ). I should say that glancing at the article, it isn't really well accepted. But it is interesting."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "This will be buried, but there could be reasons that in some sense are non-adaptive. For instance, if female sexual preference randomly evolved to favor less hairy males, then such males would beget less hairy children, who would likely inherit their mother's preference for less hairy males, forming a loop."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "What's all this evolution talk? Didn't we emerge from the Garden of Eden in this form? On a serious note, I've always been curious about the difference in evolution between male and female...why would males of our species have much facial hair, when females have mostly none? I can't think of another species on the planet that has evolved that way...except maybe the Lion...are we evolved similarly to Lions in terms of comparing our male facial hair to a male Lion's mane?"}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "So is the reason I'm hairy (I'm Indian, not native literally my parents are from India.) is because my ancestors were largely farmers and vegetarian so they didn't have to participate in hunting and the such? but still they engaged in a lot of physical activity as farmers? Or is there a reason indians are generally pretty hairy. Granted some of the hairiest people I've seen have been white."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "I imagine that it has to do with hunting. We would literally follow/chase herds to death. Long distance and sustained running inevitably caused heat exhaustion and we would overcome our prey. I'd venture to guess those of us with less hair allowed us to sustain travel further, faster and hunt more efficiently. As was the same reason for us transitioning to bipedal."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "Somewhere along the line, I got it into my head that perhaps the hair on our remaining hairy areas is intended to be a sort of \"protection\" for important parts of our bodies (e.g. heads of hair \"protecting\" the brain, the genitals, arteries near armpits, chest hair for the heart (though obviously I couldn't explain why females wouldn't have it, unless it's some evolutionary hunting thing for males). Is there any legitimate discussion/theorizing about this, or did I just make it up?"}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "I don't have references for any of this but what I remember, the purpose of keeping eye brows evolutionary was to keep sweat from dripping into your eyes while exposed to the hotter weather while humans were being nomads or whatever.

{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "Most people believe that the biggest reason, based on natural selection, for the loss of fur was the fact that fur-less homonids were no longer breeding grounds for parasites like lice that lived in fur. Some scientists have different opinions, however. There is one theory that a lack of fur allowed facial expressions to be more distinguisable, promoting higher levels of social behavior. All in all, though, it's still something that's argued on by evolutionists and nobody's completely sure."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "I could be completely wrong here, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with us evolving into bipedal creatures. Originally, while walking on all fours, most of the backside of our bodies was exposed to the sun, thus being covered with hair for protection. As we began to walk upright, we no longer relied on having that much hair on our bodies because much less of it was being exposed to the harmful rays of the sun."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "Paedomorphism. Men sexually selected women with more child-like features because the theory is that men are more protective of women who look more like children. It's why men have traits that in the ape world are adult traits, such as large brows, hair, heavy features, and women don't. Basically humans look like baby apes because we're more sexually attracted to those features. Look at a baby ape with the relative hairlessness, large eyes, big head, and flat face."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "The main reason we lost our hair is because we started wearing clothes. The hair we have left is still rather functional. In your armpits and groin, for example, it prevents your skin from sticking together, allowing air to stream by. Eyebrows and nose/ear hair prevents dirt from blocking your senses. Other places where we have hair, like head, arms and legs, are the places we least cover with clothes."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "There are a number of theories: 1. body heat regulation as Schnutzel explains 2. aesthetics (sexual selection) 3. an aquatic phase 4. to free our skin of parasites There are others.

Hair on head to protect the part exposed to the sun. Eyebrows ditto."}
{"src": "Why humans are relatively hairless?", "trg": "If something isn't inhibiting survival it won't be lost.

If a TV went for $30.00 that is 3000 bids at $1 a bid. If you win, the final cost to you is the price plus the cost of your bids, so if you bid 30 times to get that TV you spent a total of $60, not $30.

If you don't like the rules, then leave. Yeah, that seems crappy, especially if you can't afford to go elsewhere, but that's what it boils down to. You also reap benefits from being a member of society. If someone mugged you and stole your wallet you'd be justified in expecting the State to do something about it. You don't get to have the benefit of being a part of society without having to follow its rules yourself."}

Racism is everywhere, in every country and culture. You could study that for days...Bangkok Thais vs. Northeastern Thais has a real red state/blue state quality. If you want an uncommon topic for a paper, examine what it's like being a white person in some Sephardic parts of the world. You will find many examples where the system is rigged against those of white skin color. This is the norm in Asia."}
